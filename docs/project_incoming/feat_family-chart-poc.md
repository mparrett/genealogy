**Date**: 2026-01-26

## Summary

Evaluate [donatso/family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) for interactive family tree visualization on the genealogy site.

## Goals

1. Assess suitability for displaying family tree data
2. Test with sample data from one family line (e.g., Gleeson or Mowery)
3. Determine integration approach with existing GitHub Pages site

## Tasks

- [ ] Review library documentation and examples
- [ ] Set up minimal POC with sample family data
- [ ] Test responsiveness and mobile support
- [ ] Evaluate data format requirements (JSON structure)
- [ ] Consider how to maintain data (manual JSON vs. generated from other sources)
- [ ] Document findings and recommendation
