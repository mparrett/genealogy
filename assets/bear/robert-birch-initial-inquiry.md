# Initial inquiry into Robert birch

Find everything you can about this man- he raised my grandfather (Howard Higgins/Birch father James) but gave his name to him and my mother (Michele Birch) - would like to know more about his history. Connection to governor hunt, my grandma Doris Kuthe Higgins (she married James E Higgins) , etc

## What I can document about Robert W. Birch (1869–1950) from web-accessible sources

### Core identifiers

* Birth: 23 May 1869, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (appears in multiple compiled / index-style sources).
* Death: 6 Aug 1950, Yavapai County, Arizona (death noted in museum/compiled death-disposition material).

### Family background (partial, based on accessible snippets)

* He appears as a child in Canada’s 1881 census in the household of Joseph Birch (suggesting his father was Joseph Birch).
* A burial/memorial summary for Joseph Henry Birch (1842–1924) states that Joseph (and family) relocated to Prescott, Arizona “about 1906.”

### Prescott business: “Birch Bros.” (strongest set of sources)

Multiple independent sources place a “Birch Bros” establishment in Prescott in the 1910s:

1. Newspaper directory/advertising evidence (Jan 14, 1914)

2. A Prescott newspaper page includes a business listing/advertisement:

⠀
* “BIRCH BROS. BAR & CAFE”
* “Open Day and Night”
* “Good Rooms in Connection”
* “Steaks Specialty”

1. Business directory transcription (1912)

2. A 1912 Prescott business directory transcription lists:

⠀
* “Birch Bros (Robt and Sidney), saloon”

This strongly suggests:

* Robert (“Robt”) Birch was a co-owner/operator, and
* A second partner was Sidney Birch.

1. Court case describing the premises (May 1916)

2. The Arizona Supreme Court case Duff v. State (1916) describes a liquor sale episode at the “restaurant of Birch Bros” in Prescott, including:

⠀
* A bar area, a cashier stand, and private-room service,
* An “order” for whiskey during the prohibition amendment era.

### Context: Arizona statewide prohibition (ties to your “Governor Hunt” question)

Arizona’s constitutional prohibition (Article XXIII) was added in 1914 and became effective Jan 1, 1915.

That places the 1916 “Birch Bros” court case squarely inside statewide prohibition.

What I can say about a Hunt connection (with sources):

* [George W. P. Hunt](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) served as Arizona’s governor during 1912–1917 (and later terms).
* I have not found a direct source (yet) showing Robert W. Birch personally interacting with Hunt (appointment, correspondence, campaign role, etc.).
* The documented overlap is temporal/political: Birch Bros appears in records during the prohibition period that occurred while Hunt was in office.

### Death / disposition details (helpful for ordering records)

A Sharlot Hall Museum genealogy index entry (snippet) indicates:

* Death at St. Joseph’s Hospital (Prescott),
* Cause: “heart disease,” and
* References an Arizona death certificate and burial/disposition notes.

That’s a good pointer that the Arizona death certificate (1950) should be the single best primary record to pull next.

## What this suggests about the “Birch name” in your Higgins line (and what’s still missing)

From your note (“he raised my grandfather (Higgins) … gave his name to him and my mother (Birch)”): the key question is how the Birch surname entered your direct line.

Web snippets that support “Higgins → Birch” as a real surname shift:

* A Geni profile for Howard Robert Higgins (1927–2019) lists alternate names including “Howard Robert Higgins Birch” / “Howard Robert Birch.”
* A University of Arizona yearbook page (1953) includes a “Howard R. Birch” from Phoenix. (This may or may not be your Howard, but it’s consistent with a real-world “Howard R. Birch” in Arizona in the right general era.)
* A WikiTree snippet for Patricia Anne (Mowrey) describes her as wife of “Howard Robert (Higgins) Birch,” implying the Birch surname is used for him in at least one compiled tree context.

What I cannot yet document from web-accessible sources:

* The specific legal/household mechanism: adoption, guardianship, step-parent surname, informal name change, or later-life surname change.
* The direct documentary link between Robert W. Birch (1869–1950) and your grandfather in a census/guardian record.

## Highest-value next records to confirm the exact relationship (fastest path)

If you want the quickest way to turn this from “strong circumstantial” into “proven relationship,” these are the best targets:

1. Robert W. Birch’s Arizona death certificate (1950)

2. Likely lists marital status, spouse (if any), residence, and informant (often a close relative).
3. 1940 U.S. Census + 1950 U.S. Census (Arizona)

4. Look for:

⠀
* Your grandfather in the Birch household (or adjacent households),
* A “relationship to head of household” field that explicitly states “step-son,” “adopted son,” “ward,” etc.

1. Guardianship / adoption records (Arizona)

2. If your grandfather was raised by Robert Birch due to a parent’s death or separation, guardianship filings are common and can be very explicit.
3. Marriage record(s) that could connect Doris to Birch

4. If Doris remarried a Birch (or a Birch married into the household), that can explain the surname transition. I didn’t find a web-available marriage record in this pass; it may exist in indexed form but not be easily exposed without a database search.

## What I can do next if you want to keep going (no extra questions required)

If you share your grandfather’s full name + birth/death years + where he lived in 1930–1950 (even approximate city/state), I can target:

* specific census hits,
* Arizona newspaper mentions (name-change notices, obits, social columns),
* and any public indexes that might show a guardianship/adoption trail.

If you don’t want to share that here, an alternative is: paste whatever you already have (one obituary, one census entry, one marriage record), and I’ll connect it to the Birch timeline above.
