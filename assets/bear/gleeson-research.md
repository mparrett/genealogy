# Gleeson/Fitzgerald Research — First Pass (Web Search)
I'm researching the Gleeson and Fitzgerald families who ended up in Arizona. Their Ireland-to-US story is sparse and I'd like to fill it in. Please search what you can find using free/public web sources.

## What I know

- **James J. Gleeson** (1863–1946): 2nd great-grandfather. Baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick (FamilySearch index: Jacobus; parents Patritii Gleeson + Margaritæ Moloney; image unavailable—may need NLI parish register images). Obituary rounded birth year to 1864.
- **Maria Ann Fitzgerald** (1865–1916): 2nd great-grandmother. Irish origin assumed.
- **Anne B. Gleeson** (1903–1986): Their daughter, my great-grandmother. Lived in Arizona. Married Raymond R. Mowrey (1899–1973).

The family ended up in Arizona but I don't know:
- Where in Ireland either family came from
- When they immigrated (James/Maria themselves, or their parents?)
- Where they first settled in the US
- How/when they got to Arizona

## What I'd like you to search

### James J. Gleeson (b. 1863, d. 1946)
- US Census records (1870–1940) — where was he living? Birthplace listed?
- Was he born in Ireland or in the US to Irish parents?
- Immigration/passenger records if he came from Ireland
- Marriage record to Maria Ann Fitzgerald — where and when?
- Death record / Find a Grave / obituary
- Any naturalization records?

### Maria Ann Fitzgerald (b. 1865, d. 1916)
- Same census searches — birthplace listed as Ireland or US?
- Parents' names if available from any record
- Death record (1916 is early enough for state records in most places)
- Find a Grave
- Where did she die? (Arizona? Elsewhere?)

### Anne B. Gleeson (b. 1903, d. 1986)
- Where was she born? (This tells us where James & Maria were living by 1903)
- Marriage to Raymond Mowrey — where/when?
- 1910/1920 census with parents

### General
- Are there Gleeson/Fitzgerald clusters in any particular US city/state that might indicate a first landing point?
- Any Arizona territorial records for Gleeson?
- Irish emigration patterns — are there known Gleeson/Fitzgerald origins in specific Irish counties?

## Format

For each person, give me:
1. What you found (with source)
2. What it tells us about the Ireland → US → Arizona path
3. Any leads worth pursuing further

Keep it concise — this is a first pass to see what's out there before I do a deeper dive.
