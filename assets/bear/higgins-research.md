## RESOLVED Questions

### The Timeline Problem
**Original confusion:** Mary Knight died "widowed" in Feb 1930, but Laurence Higgins supposedly died in 1940.
**Resolution:** Laurence Higgins died **before February 17, 1930** — the 1940 date was incorrect.

### The 1905 Institution
**Question:** Why was James in an institution at age 13?
**Resolution:** James and sister Theresa were inmates at **St Agatha's Home For Children** in Nanuet, NY — per NY State Census records.

### James's Death in "Jail"
**Question:** Why did he die in jail? Was he a criminal?
**Resolution:** James died in the **lodger's cell** at SF City Prison — a free overnight shelter, not incarceration. Financial troubles.

### Howard's "Birch" Surname — SOLVED
**Question:** How did Howard get the "Birch" surname? Did Doris remarry?
**Resolution:**
- Doris did NOT marry a Birch
- **c. 1931:** During the Depression, Howard was sent to a **Catholic orphanage in Silver City, NM** along with his cousin **Willis "Bill" Rosser** (son of Jessie Kuthe)
- Howard was fostered/adopted by **Robert Birch (1869–1950)** and **Sarah Cope Birch (1878–1959)**
- Doris was friends with Mary Birch and attended her Oct 1930 wedding
- Howard later married **Patricia Anne Mowrey** (daughter of Anne Barbara Gleeson) — reconnecting the Higgins and Gleeson lines

### 2. Irish Origins
**Higgins (Dublin):**
