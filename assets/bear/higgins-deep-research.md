# Deep Research: Higgins/Knight Line — Unresolved Questions
Building on initial research. Need help resolving specific confusions and going deeper on Irish origins. Web sources only.

## Priority 1: The Mary Knight / Laurence Higgins Timeline Problem

**The confusion (resolved):**
- Mary Knight (née) Higgins died **27 Mar 1930** in a New York almshouse
- She was listed as **"widowed"** at admission (17 Feb 1930)
- But Laurence Higgins supposedly died in **1940**
  - 2026-01-26 : The 1940 date was tenative; corrected on ancestry to "BEFORE 17 Feb 1930"; still seeking death record

**Possible explanations:**
1. Laurence's death date (1940) is wrong — he died before 1930
   1. YES; see above
2. They were separated/divorced
   1. POSSIBLY, but haven't heard of such
3. The Mary Higgins in the almshouse is a different person
   1. REMOTELY POSSIBLE; we believe it is her because of family connections (via daughter Patricia)
4. "Widowed" was recorded in error
   1. also possible but myabe remote

**What I need:**
- Death record for Laurence Higgins — when and where did he actually die?
  - still need
- Marriage record for Laurence Higgins + Mary Knight — when/where?
  - NY has records 6 Feb 1887 in Manhattan, with witnesses CHRISTOPHER HIGGINS and MARGARET MCGRATH
  - They were also married in Dublin, Ireland pre-emigration 25 Nov 1883 -- records can be located
- Census records 1900, 1910, 1920 showing them together (or not)
  - Seems like some records show them living in NJ early on, then NY later.
- Any divorce records?
  - None have been found
- Confirm the almshouse Mary Higgins is the same as Mary Knight
  - Fairly certain due to dauther's name and connections

## Priority 2: Howard R. Higgins Birch — The Dual Surname

**The confusion:**
- Howard R. Higgins Birch (1922–2019) was son of James E. Higgins + Doris Kuthe
- His children carry surname "Birch" not "Higgins"
- Why both surnames? Adoption? Mother remarried?
  - Howard's father James separated from Doris when he was young; possibly in an orphanage in NM before that -- Doris' sister Jessie was there, maybe both of their boys? Howard was raised by a Robert Birch (proprietor of Agua Caliente Hot Springs in AZ) and that's how he got the surname. (His bio father was not around due to [tenatively] railroad career and/or trouble with Doris -- resided in SF)

**What I need:**
- Did Doris Kuthe remarry after James E. Higgins died (1938)?
  - Yes, but this is not a focal point right now.
- Marriage record for Doris to someone named "Birch"?
  - See above; not relevant.
- When did the Birch surname get attached to Howard?
  - Still trying to pinpoint, let me get back to you
- Was Howard legally adopted by a Birch?
  - We're still looking- possible leads in NM but nothing definitive

**Timeline to check:**
- James E. Higgins dies 1938 (Howard is ~16)
- Doris would have been widowed with a teenage son
  - Yes
- Did she remarry?
  - Yes- but Howard was raised by the Birches; Doris was active and focused on her career in the early education system.

## Priority 3: James Everett Higgins — Path to Arizona

**Questions:**
- Born 1892 — where? (New York? Based on parents' location)
  - Yes, NY (Manhattan - Feb 2, 1892) - have rcords
- Census records 1900, 1910, 1920 — where was he living?
  - 1920 - San Fran. 1910 - pretty sure San Fran.
- How/why did he end up in Phoenix, Arizona by 1926?
  - Info about meeting my grandmother Doris is sparse, but it's likely the railroad brought them together. They ended up in Phoenix in 1926 because they were married and eventually had Howard in Tucson
- Did he follow the Kuthe family there? (George Kuthe moved to Phoenix after 1907)
  - Possibly? We haven't found a Higgins+Kuthe connection in Oregon yet, but the railroad makes it plausible.
- What was his occupation?
  - Civil engineer, railroad.
- Death 1938 — where, cause of death?
  - Suicide
- What does the "E" stand for? (Everett? Edward? Eugene?)
  - Everett

## Priority 4: Irish Origins

### Higgins family
- Laurence born c. 1854 — Ireland? What county?
  - We think Rathmines 08 JANUARY 1854
- Parents' names?
  - James Higgins (b. c. 1830) and Jane Eustace (b. c. 1829)
- Higgins is common in Ireland — any clues to narrow down (Mayo, Sligo, Clare are common)
  - See above
- Note: Laurence was also married to a Mary Verner (in Ireland, before Mary Knight)

### Knight family
- Mary's parents: James Knight + Bridget Larney
- Any records for them in Ireland or US?
- What county in Ireland?
- Larney/Larne suggests possible Ulster connection?

## Priority 5: New York Connections

Based on Mary's death in NYC and possible family base there:
- Search for Higgins/Knight in New York census records
- Any other Higgins or Knight family members in NYC area?
- Church records (likely Catholic given Irish background)

## Specific Records to Find

1. **Laurence Higgins death record** — critical to resolve the 1930/1940 conflict
2. **Laurence + Mary marriage record** — where/when married
3. **1900/1910/1920 census** for Higgins household
4. **James E. Higgins death certificate** (1938) — Arizona?
5. **Doris Kuthe remarriage record** — if she married someone named Birch
6. **Howard R. Higgins birth certificate** — does it show Higgins or Birch?

## Constraints

- Web-only research
- Free sources preferred (FamilySearch, Find a Grave, Ancestry previews)
- Focus on resolving the timeline conflicts before building out the fuller narrative

## Format

For each priority:
1. What you found
2. Confidence level
3. Does it resolve or deepen the confusion?
4. Recommended next steps
