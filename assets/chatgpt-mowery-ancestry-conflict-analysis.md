I’ll review the files you uploaded, extract your tentative claims, and then flag anything that looks conflicting, ambiguous, or weakly supported—organized by person and by the exact issue to research next.


## What looks ambiguous, conflicting, or “record-mix” risk

Below I’m treating the Ancestry-style timeline entries as *claims* that need a specific underlying record to trust. I’m flagging places where (a) two timeline entries disagree, (b) an entry is internally odd, or (c) the “shape” looks like a misattached record for a similarly named person.

## Samuel S. Mowrey (Feb 1867 – 29 Aug 1904)

### 1) Conflicting marriage date (same spouse)

* **Marriage to Effie May Coker** appears twice: **12 Jun 1897** and **13 Jun 1897** (Lamar County, TX).

  * This is a classic “index vs record date” problem or two different sources being merged; but it’s still a conflict worth resolving with the actual marriage record.

### 2) Child/relationship ambiguity: “Cecilia Mae Hambrock Coker Bond (1895–1989)”

* Cecilia is listed as a **daughter** with birth **3 Mar 1895**, but Samuel’s marriage to Effie is **1897**.

  * Possible explanations (needs proof): Cecilia could be **Effie’s child from a prior relationship**, a **stepchild**, or Samuel and Effie had an earlier relationship not represented as a marriage.
  * The compound surname string (“Hambrock Coker Bond”) is a strong hint she may not be Samuel’s biological child, or she had later marriages and Ancestry is over-labeling the relationship.

### 3) Major conflict: 1904 New Jersey + “Soldier” vs death in Texas

* **Residence:** “5 Apr 1904 • New Jersey, USA”
* **Death:** “29 Aug 1904 • Lamar Co, Texas”
* Then an extra “Residence — Relation to Head: Soldier” (no date)

  * This combination is the biggest red flag in the set: it could be true (military service and then death back in TX), but it also matches the pattern of a **different Samuel Mowrey/Mowery** getting merged in.
  * Also: “5 Apr 1904” is not a common census enumeration date; it feels like an **event date** from a military register, service card, hospital admission, discharge, enlistment, etc. Without the source record, it’s ambiguous.

### 4) Same-day deaths with father (potential shared event)

* Samuel’s death: **29 Aug 1904**
* Father Moses’s death: **29 Aug 1904**

  * That may be true, but it’s unusual enough that it needs primary confirmation and a cause-of-death explanation (epidemic, accident, etc.).
  * High likelihood of “date propagation” from one person into another in trees.

### 5) Missing-support risk: Sources list doesn’t explain key claims

* Your Sources list for Samuel shows: **1870/1880/1900 census + marriage index + some generic indexes**.
* But the most questionable timeline items (New Jersey 1904; “Soldier”; death specifics) don’t obviously correspond to those sources.

  * That mismatch is a **metadata integrity issue**: the claims may be coming from a record not listed here, or from a tree hint.

## Moses Mansfield Mowery/Mowrey (1 Nov 1822 – 29 Aug 1904)

### 1) Conflict: Wife death year vs 1900 census “widowed”

* Spouse listed: **Margaret Elizabeth Witt** with death year **1904**.
* Moses in **1900** is listed as **widowed**.

  * If the 1900 record is correct for Moses, Margaret’s death should be **before 1900**.
  * Alternatively, the 1900 “Moses” record could be the wrong Moses, or “widowed” is incorrect (less common, but possible).

### 2) Highly suspicious paired parent deaths on the same date in different places

* Father Lewis R. Mowery death: **20 Aug 1859 • Hempstead County, Arkansas**
* Mother Elizabeth “Betsy” Lisbee death: **20 Aug 1859 • Lamar County, Texas**

  * Same exact date for both parents, but different jurisdictions/states, is improbable.
  * This looks like either (a) a copied placeholder date, (b) two different couples conflated, or (c) one death date applied to both parents.

### 3) Children’s birth locations suggest either real moves or record drift

* Children born in **Tennessee** through 1851, then:

  * **1855**: Moses G born in **Clarksville, Red River, TX**
  * **1856**: Bettie born in **Bristol, Ellis, TX**
  * **1859**: Sarah born in **Clarksville, Red River, TX**
* Ellis County (Bristol) vs Red River County (Clarksville) is not impossible, but it is a big enough geographic shift that it’s a **verification hotspot** (are these locations from real records, or from downstream trees?).

### 4) Birth location precision looks like an index artifact

* “Bradley County, Subdivision 26, Tennessee” for Moses’s birth.

  * That wording often comes from a particular enumeration/administrative unit in a census context rather than a birth certificate context.
  * It may be correct, but it suggests the “birthplace” could be reverse-inferred from a census record, not an actual birth record.

### 5) Name consistency risk: Mowery vs Mowrey (and others)

* Across the set: **Mowery** and **Mowrey** are used interchangeably.

  * That’s normal historically, but it greatly increases the risk of merging the wrong person when you see “Soldier / New Jersey / 1904” style records.

## Raymond Robert Mowrey (20 Dec 1899 – Jun 1973)

### 1) Out-of-place “Residence Lamar, Texas… relation to head: Mother”

* At the end of the timeline: “Residence • Lamar, Texas, USA • Relative Relation to Head: Mother”

  * This reads like a household-role field from a census record, but it’s attached without an obvious date and doesn’t fit the surrounding late-life Arizona items.
  * Strong chance it’s either misattached or a mis-parsed fragment from another record.

### 2) Parent/relationship incompleteness in the export

* In Relationships, Raymond’s **Parents** section shows **Effie May Coker** (image) but does not clearly list **Samuel S. Mowrey** as father there (even though the timeline references Samuel as father).

  * That inconsistency may be just export formatting, but it’s worth checking the actual profile relationships: is Samuel definitively attached as father, or inferred?

### 3) Marriage sequence ambiguity

* Marriage: **May Smith** on **21 May 1921** (Lamar County, TX)
* Another marriage: **Anne Barbara Gleeson** “Abt 1930”

  * Could be real (divorce/remarriage), but until you see marriage/divorce records, it’s ambiguous—especially because “about 1930” is often tree-derived.

### 4) Half-sibling claims that need grounding

* Half-sisters: “Ms Phil Freed” and “P.H. Reed” both “About 1900”
* Half-sisters later: Loyce Maxine Dawson (1913, OK) and Thelma Dawson Armack (1915, TX)

  * These are plausible if Effie remarried (the Dawson surname also appears in the later obit references), but the “Freed” and “Reed” entries are vague and look like placeholders.
  * This is a good candidate for “Ancestry hint suggestions that got saved without strong records.”

### 5) Newspaper/event items: identity confirmation needed

* Several Williams, AZ items (Rotary, American Legion, Sultana Bar/Buffet) look coherent, but newspaper indexes can match multiple similar names.

  * Not a conflict by itself—just a “confirm it’s the same Raymond” checkpoint.

## Cross-cutting “mystery clusters” (highest value to resolve)

1. **29 Aug 1904 dual deaths (Moses and Samuel)**
   Needs primary death documentation and cause-of-death context; could be true, but also could be date-copying or profile merge.

2. **Samuel’s 1904 New Jersey / “Soldier” fragment**
   This is the single strongest indicator of either military service *or* wrong-person merge.

3. **Moses’s spouse death year (1904) vs 1900 “widowed”**
   Either the 1900 Moses record is wrong, or the spouse death year is wrong, or both profiles are polluted by tree data.

4. **Parent death dates (Lewis and Betsy both “20 Aug 1859” in different places)**
   Very likely an error or conflation, and it directly impacts your earlier open question about Lewis’s actual death window.

If you want, in the next step we can turn this into a prioritized research plan that starts by “locking” identities with the least ambiguous primary sources (death certificates, marriage records, census households), and only then expanding to military/service records and newspapers.
