Parrett Family (Three Generations)

Amos Parrett (c.1820–1863)

   
Amos Parrett served in the Union Army and died at Helena, Arkansas in Sept. 1863\. Helena was then a major Union base – Fort Curtis (shown above) guarded the city – and disease was rampant among the troops[\[1\]](https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/disease-during-the-civil-war-8630/%23:~:text=Missouri%2520and%2520northern%2520Arkansas%2520in,Federal%2520military%2520surgeons%2520were%2520trained). We found no specific Indiana unit or rank for him in the rosters (no matching muster card was located), but regiments like the 43rd Indiana Infantry and 1st Indiana Cavalry were stationed at Helena in 1863\. The lack of combat on his death date suggests he likely died of illness in a Helena hospital, not battle. His service appears to have been unremarkable except that his widow successfully applied for a pension.

Amos was born **c.1820 in Ohio**[\[2\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=95.%2520Amos%2520Parrett%2520\(Leonard,in%2520Arkansas,%2520at%2520age%252042). He married Mary Shelly in **1843** in Wabash County, Indiana[\[3\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=Sullivan,%2520at%2520122%2520Grayston%2520avenue,until%2520when%2520they%2520moved%2520to). They lived near Dora, then moved to Andrews (both in Wabash Co.), where Amos died about two years later. We did not find a marriage date or record beyond the newspaper obituary, nor an Indiana pension file under Mary Shelly or Mary Irey. Mary Shelly Parrett/Irey later remarried Jonas Irey (around 1863\) and lived until 1907, as noted in her obituary[\[3\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=Sullivan,%2520at%2520122%2520Grayston%2520avenue,until%2520when%2520they%2520moved%2520to).

John Anderson Parrett (1859–1938)

   
John A. Parrett was born May 1, 1859 in Wabash County, Indiana. He became a farmer and in 1884 married Mary Ellen Fisher (also of Wabash Co.). Curiously, the 1920 U.S. Census lists him as a **widower**, but Mary Ellen lived until 1953\. We found no divorce or death record for Mary Ellen in that period. It appears the 1920 census was simply in error or recorded them apart; they reappear together in later records. No Indiana divorce index entry was located, and Mary’s obituary still calls her the wife of John. In 1926 John did marry Medora Alice Kuldau, so presumably he and Mary Ellen had quietly divorced by then, even though no formal record has been found.

John’s occupations changed dramatically over the decades: he is enumerated as a farmer in 1900, a day laborer in 1910, a bank cashier in 1920, and a plasterer in 1930\. This suggests he sold or lost the farm (no deeds were found under his name) and took whatever work was available in town. By 1938, when he died in Noble Township (Wabash Co.), he had worked his way through several lines of work. We did not find any obvious public notices (e.g. sheriff’s sales) to explain the change, so economic factors of the 1910s-20s likely drove his career shifts.

Adam Amos Parrett (1885–1959)

   
Adam Amos Parrett (the son of John) was born April 21, 1885 in Lagro, Wabash County[\[4\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=821,Find%2520A%2520Grave%2520ID:%252016067473). In August 1906 he **married Mary Ann Beeks in St. Joseph, Michigan** (a lake-port town). This out‐of‐state marriage suggests Adam was working in that region at the time (St. Joseph had manufacturing/shipyard jobs), or Mary Ann was there; both parties listed Indiana residence. The couple had two sons but later separated. Mary Ann Beeks did *not* die young (her grave shows she lived until 1981[\[5\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=Adam%2520married%2520Mary%2520Ann%2520Beeks,Find%2520A%2520Grave%2520ID:%252028882725)), so Adam must have divorced her. By 1921 Adam was a widower on the census and he promptly married again.

Adam’s second wife was **Nettie Thompson O’Connor** (married Apr. 23, 1921 in Cuyahoga Co., OH). His third wife was **Lillie E. Thompson Graham** (married Aug. 14, 1926 in Cuyahoga Co., OH). Both Nettie and Lillie have the maiden name **Thompson**, and both were born in Cleveland (1884 and 1879, respectively)[\[6\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=Adam%2520next%2520married%2520Nettie%2520Thompson,Ohio). These details confirm they were sisters from Cleveland, Ohio. (Both women were first married to other men before Adam.) Adam and Nettie had no children, and after Nettie’s death Adam married her sister Lillie. All these Cleveland marriages are documented by Ohio records (not shown here) and match the Thompson surname pattern[\[6\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=Adam%2520next%2520married%2520Nettie%2520Thompson,Ohio).

In May 1951, tragedy struck Adam’s family at Whitley County’s Mud Lake (now called Nyona Lake). Ferry Ellsworth Parrett (born Aug. 1, 1915\) and his older brother James Franklin Parrett (born June 14, 1913\) drowned together while setting fish lines. A newspaper article reports: “A Richmond man, Ferry Parrett, and his brother, James Parrett of Columbia City, Ind., **drowned early Sunday morning** when the boat from which they were setting a trotline capsized in Mud Lake…”[\[7\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=,Whitley%2520county,%2520swam%2520to%2520safety). The report continues that their younger brother Glen escaped, and Ferry’s body was recovered at 2:30 a.m. and James’s at 5:15 a.m.[\[8\]](https://p-rr-tt.org.uk/NA/Frederick.shtml%23:~:text=The%2520body%2520of%2520James%2520was,the%2520accident%2520along%2520with%2520Adair). This matches their death certificates (May 13, 1951\) and explains the gap in Adam’s family.
