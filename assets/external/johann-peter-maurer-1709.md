## Research Notes

Discrepency at this ancestor line--name, birthdate and then lineage going back differ--unsure how to determine correct one. Wife/mother info the same for both. In reviewing sources, it seems I have the correct one--even the sources for the second man are for Johann Peter. (Litwig Johan Peter Mowery Maurer GW3F-ZMR)

This is because German boys almost always were baptized with the first name Johannes (or Johann, abbreviated Joh). German girls were baptized Maria, Anna or Anna Maria. (This tradition started in the Middle Ages.) This means a family could (and commonly did) have five boys with the first name Johann.
