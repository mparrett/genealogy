## Notes

Shenandoah County Virginia, USA Death: Aug. 2, 1847 Wilmington Clinton County Ohio, USA Joseph enlisted as a private in Captain Jonathan Clark's Company, Colonel Peter Muhlenberg's 8th Virginia Regiment, and served until Dec. 25th, 1777, when he was made Lieutenant and Purchasing Commissary of Privisions and clothing for the army at Valley Forge. He was in the battles of Brandywind and Germantown and at the taking of Cornwallis, and was discharged in Nov. 1781 at Woodstock, VA. He served 5 years and 10 months. for the above, he was allowed a pension and 200 acres of bounty land. He moved to Ohio about 1812 and settled in Fayette Cty., about 5 miles north of Washington C.H. He later in life married Anna Hartman from Clinton Cty., and lived at Wilmington until his death. Owing to the fact that he had a military funeral and there was to be a salute fired over the grave, he was refused burial in the cemetery (Quaker) and was buried just outside the wall in the old Morris woods. We have been told that as the procession came down the street the small boys sang: "The boys hallowing down the street Captain Parretts funerals coming with barclay harlan in the lead and Vandeburg adrumming" The old cemetery and woods have long been merged into the town, and the grave site was located in an alley, but a marker to Capt. Parrett has been placed on the soldier's lot in Sugar Grove cemetery.
