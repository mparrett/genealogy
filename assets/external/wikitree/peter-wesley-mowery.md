[![1776 Project](https://www.wikitree.com/photo.php/thumb/e/e9/1776_Project_Images-2.png/50px-1776_Project_Images-2.png)](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Project:1776)

Private Peter (Maurer) Mowery served with Augusta County Militia, Virginia Militia during the American Revolution.

Peter Mowery was born in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania on the 15th of September 1760, where he lived only a few years prior to his family's move to Augusta County, Virginia.

In the fall of 1780, Peter entered the Army of the United States as a drafted militia man in Augusta County, Virginia. He was enrolled with Captain Hays, in a company commanded by Captain Thomas Smith, who he believed was attached to a Regiment commanded by Colonel Campbell. A short time before the Battle of Guilford he joined the Continental Army under General Nathanael Greene and was in the Battle of Guilford on 15th March 1781.

Peter resided in Augusta County, Virginia for ten or twelve years after the war. He then moved to Sullivan County, Tennessee where he lived about one year, then he moved to Knox County, Tennessee where he lived until he died. Peter filed for an invalid's pension for his service during the American Revolution from Knox County in 1833. He was pensioned at the rate of $20 per annum, commencing 4th March 1831.

He was lastly married 4th May 1829 in Knox County to Sophia Clapp. There is no evidence of children born to the couple. His will was dated 16th June 1838 and presented for probate in February 1840.

## Research Notes

[Peter White](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/White-68862), who married to Peter Mowry's daughter Anna, undoubtedly had a brother James White, who married Peter Mowry's daughter, **Agnes Mowery**, by bond dated 20 July 1801 with the same Samuel Brooks as surety on his marriage bond in Knox County, Tennessee. It appears an A. White attested to their bond.[\[1\]](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939Z-Y895-SD?i=789&cc=1619127 "https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939Z-Y895-SD?i=789&cc=1619127") The 1820[\[2\]](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYBZ-C7B?i=28&cc=1803955&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXHLJ-45L "https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYBZ-C7B?i=28&cc=1803955&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXHLJ-45L"), & 1830[\[3\]](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYBC-9HQV?i=87&cc=1803958&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXHG2-XG9 "https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYBC-9HQV?i=87&cc=1803958&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXHG2-XG9")census indicates the White brothers may have lived in a neighborly fashion in Jackson County, Tennessee.

German girls were baptized Maria, Anna or Anna Maria. (This tradition started in the Middle Ages.) This means a family could (and commonly did) have five boys with the first name Johann.)
