# Feature: Freeform Bio Alternative Formats

## Summary

Explore alternative page formats beyond the standard biography template. These would offer deeper, more immersive ways to present a person's life story while still connecting to family research.

## Proposed Formats

### 1. "Life & Times" Immersive Page
Weave the subject's story with historical context: what was happening in the world/region during key moments of their life? Period photos, news events, social context alongside the personal narrative.

### 2. "Place-Based" Journey
Organize by locations rather than chronology. Each section explores what those places were like at the time the subject lived there. Maps, period images, local history woven with personal story.

### 3. "Connections" Web
Visual/narrative exploration of how one person's life intersected with others. Shows how a single person becomes a node connecting disparate family threads and historical figures.

### 4. "The Resort" / Place-as-Character Feature
Focus deeply on a significant place in the subject's life - the place itself becomes a character. Period advertisements, what daily life was like there, notable events. Subject as host/impresario.

### 5. "Guardian" / Relationship Narrative
Centers a specific relationship or role rather than full biography. Explores themes like informal adoption, mentorship, or caregiving - the human story within the genealogical record.

## Implementation Notes

- May require new templates or custom HTML/CSS
- Consider how these integrate with existing line pages and standard bios
- Could link from standard bio to "deep dive" alternative format
- Image generation prompts may need adjustment for different visual styles
