### Base Template for Genealogy Graphics

Use this template for all genealogy-related graphics to ensure consistency:

```
Create a vintage-style illustration representing [SPECIFIC TOPIC/PERIOD]. The design should be suitable for use as either a background element or icon in genealogy research reports. Include elements like:

- [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS FOR THIS TOPIC/PERIOD]
- [GEOGRAPHIC/HISTORICAL DETAILS]
- [RELEVANT ACTIVITIES/OBJECTS]
- Warm, earthy color palette (browns, golds, muted greens)
- Soft, aged appearance with slight sepia tones

Style: Historical illustration with a clean, not overly detailed approach that works well as a background element. The design should feel authentic to the [TIME PERIOD] but remain legible and not too busy when used behind text.

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (use for all genealogy graphics):
- Maintain the same vintage illustration style with sepia/aged tones
- Use consistent warm, earthy color palette across all images
- Keep the same level of detail and artistic approach
- All graphics should complement each other as part of a cohesive genealogy research collection
- Ensure typography and decorative elements (if any) match this historical aesthetic

Format: Square aspect ratio, suitable for web use. The design should work both as a subtle background and as a standalone decorative element.

### George Washington Kuthe (1869–1925) - German-American Migration

```
Create a vintage-style illustration representing German-American migration and farming in the late 1800s/early 1900s American West. The design should be suitable for use as either a background element or icon in genealogy research reports. Include elements like:

- Rolling farmland or prairie landscape typical of Missouri/Oregon farming regions
- A modest farmhouse with German-American architectural influences (perhaps steep-roofed barn)
- Horse-drawn farming equipment or a wagon suggesting westward migration
- Railroad tracks or train in the distance (representing late 1800s migration routes)
- Desert elements subtly in the background (representing eventual move to Arizona)
- Warm, earthy color palette (browns, golds, muted greens)
- Soft, aged appearance with slight sepia tones

Style: Historical illustration with a clean, not overly detailed approach that works well as a background element. The design should feel authentic to the 1870s-1920s period of German-American settlement and westward migration but remain legible and not too busy when used behind text.
