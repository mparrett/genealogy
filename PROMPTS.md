### Base Template for Genealogy Graphics

Use this template for all genealogy-related graphics to ensure consistency:

```
Create a vintage-style illustration representing [SPECIFIC TOPIC/PERIOD]. The design should be suitable for use as either a background element or icon in genealogy research reports. Include elements like:

- [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS FOR THIS TOPIC/PERIOD]
- [GEOGRAPHIC/HISTORICAL DETAILS]
- [RELEVANT ACTIVITIES/OBJECTS]
- Warm, earthy color palette (browns, golds, muted greens)
- Soft, aged appearance with slight sepia tones

Style: Historical illustration with a clean, not overly detailed approach that works well as a background element. The design should feel authentic to the [TIME PERIOD] but remain legible and not too busy when used behind text.

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (use for all genealogy graphics):
- Maintain the same vintage illustration style with sepia/aged tones
- Use consistent warm, earthy color palette across all images
- Keep the same level of detail and artistic approach
- All graphics should complement each other as part of a cohesive genealogy research collection
- Ensure typography and decorative elements (if any) match this historical aesthetic

Format: Square aspect ratio, suitable for web use. The design should work both as a subtle background and as a standalone decorative element.
