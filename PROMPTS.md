### Lewis R. Mowery (c. 1780s-1850s) - German Immigrant, Tennessee Pioneer

```
Create a vintage-style illustration representing German immigration to early Tennessee in the early 1800s. The design should be suitable for use as either a background element or icon in genealogy research reports. Include elements like:

- Appalachian foothills landscape typical of East Tennessee (Knox/Bradley Counties)
- A simple log cabin or early settler's homestead with German architectural influences
- Perhaps a covered wagon or cart suggesting immigration/migration
- Split-rail fencing and cleared farmland showing frontier settlement
- Distant mountains (Great Smoky Mountains) in the background
- Tools of early farming and homesteading (axe, plow, etc.)
- Warm, earthy color palette (browns, golds, muted greens)
- Soft, aged appearance with slight sepia tones

Style: Historical illustration with a clean, not overly detailed approach that works well as a background element. The design should feel authentic to the 1800-1840s German-American frontier settlement period in Tennessee but remain legible and not too busy when used behind text.

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (use for all genealogy graphics):
- Maintain the same vintage illustration style with sepia/aged tones
- Use consistent warm, earthy color palette across all images
- Keep the same level of detail and artistic approach
- All graphics should complement each other as part of a cohesive genealogy research collection
- Ensure typography and decorative elements (if any) match this historical aesthetic

Format: Square aspect ratio, suitable for web use. The design should work both as a subtle background and as a standalone decorative element.

### Elizabeth "Betsy" Lusby Mowery (c. 1790s-1850s) - Tennessee Native, Pioneer Wife

```
Create a vintage-style illustration representing Tennessee pioneer women and early family life in the 1800s. The design should be suitable for use as either a background element or icon in genealogy research reports. Include elements like:

- Tennessee landscape with rolling hills and early settlements
- A log cabin or simple wooden home with smoke rising from chimney
- Pioneer family life elements: garden plots, washing areas, children playing
- Split-rail fencing and farm animals (chickens, cow, etc.)
- Traditional pioneer women's work: spinning wheel, garden tools, hanging laundry
- Native Tennessee vegetation and wildflowers
- Warm, earthy color palette (browns, golds, muted greens)
- Soft, aged appearance with slight sepia tones

Style: Historical illustration with a clean, not overly detailed approach that works well as a background element. The design should feel authentic to the 1800-1850s Tennessee pioneer family life but remain legible and not too busy when used behind text.
