# Hypothesis: The Railroad Connection

## Summary

James Everett Higgins (railroad civil engineer) may have met Doris Kuthe through the Arizona railroad/resort network that connected Hyder, Agua Caliente, and the Birch family.

## The Theory

1. **James E. Higgins** was a railroad civil engineer working Western Pacific and possibly other southwestern lines in the 1910s-1920s

2. **Hyder, Arizona** was a railroad hub with daily eastbound/westbound passenger trains during this era

3. **Agua Caliente Hot Springs** (14 miles from Hyder) was the resort destination for railroad travelers - a 22-room hotel built in 1897 specifically catering to train passengers

4. **Robert W. Birch** operated Agua Caliente from the 1910s-1940s, making him a known figure in this railroad/resort circuit

5. **James and Doris** married in Tucson in November 1926 - they likely met somewhere in this Arizona railroad network

6. **When Howard needed a home** (1928), the Birches weren't random strangers - they were connected people in a small Arizona world. The railroad/resort network explains how a baby born to a railroad engineer's wife ended up with the hot springs hotelier.

## Evidence Needed

- [ ] James E. Higgins employment records - which railroads, which routes?
- [ ] Doris Kuthe's Arizona timeline before 1926 - where was she living?
- [ ] Any record of James or Doris at Agua Caliente or Hyder
- [ ] Robert Birch's guest registers (if extant)
- [ ] Newspaper social columns mentioning any of these parties

## Supporting Context

From azcentral (2015):
> "Built in 1897, the 22-room adobe hotel catered mostly to travelers coming from the town of Hyder. Hyder is now a ghost town, but several eastbound and westbound passenger trains arrived there daily during its heyday, and weary passengers no doubt benefited from the therapeutic mineral springs."

## Status

Speculative - plausible connection based on geography and timing, but no direct evidence yet.
