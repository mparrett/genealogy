# 1. Maria Ann Fitzgerald’s Parents (Sauk County, WI)

Maria Ann Fitzgerald (b. 3 Jul 1865, Ironton, Sauk Co., WI) was the daughter of James Fitzgerald (1828–1899) and Margaret (Murlagh) Fitzgerald . Both parents were Irish-born. According to family records, James Fitzgerald was born in Dromin/Athlacca, County Limerick, Ireland . He married Margaret “Murlagh” (possibly Murtagh – an Irish surname) on 28 Feb 1854 , likely after immigrating. James appears as a farmer in Wisconsin census records: in 1870 the family was in Ironton, Sauk Co., with children William, John, Jane, and Maria (ages roughly teenage to toddler) – all born in Wisconsin (census details should confirm ages and birthplace “Ireland” for the parents) – and by 1880 they had moved to Buffalo County, WI . In the 1880 census (Town of Naples, Buffalo Co.), James (listed as born in Ireland) is head of household with wife Margaret and their younger children (including Maria and Jane) still at home . James’s occupation is not explicitly cited in our sources, but given the rural setting he was likely a farmer. He died 30 Sep 1899 in Mondovi, Buffalo Co., WI , and is buried at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Mondovi. Margaret’s exact Irish birthplace is not yet known (no county is given in census records, only “Ireland”), and her maiden name Moloney is not attested in these U.S. records – see Section 5 for clarification. Further research in church records or immigration manifests may be needed to pinpoint Margaret’s origin. (Note: One family tree source lists her surname as “Murlagh,” which appears to be an error or variant spelling of Murtagh .)

Household Composition: In 1870, James and Margaret’s household in Ironton likely included their older sons William Fitzgerald (born ~1855–60) and John Fitzgerald (c.1860?), and daughters Jane (often “Jennie”) and Maria (born 1865) – all of whom are confirmed as siblings by later family records. By 1880, William and John may have left home or been working elsewhere (they are not listed with the family in Buffalo Co.), while 15-year-old Maria and her sister Jane (about 11) lived with James and Margaret in Buffalo Co. . The 1880 census indicates James and Margaret were both born in Ireland (with an “Irish” birthplace recorded), and their children born in Wisconsin, consistent with an immigration in the 1850s or early 1860s. James’s brother Richard Fitzgerald (b. ~1826 Limerick) was also an early settler in Buffalo Co. , suggesting the Fitzgerald family from Limerick had multiple members in that area. (Indeed, a Richard Fitzgerald biography notes he arrived in Mondovi in the 1860s , possibly encouraging James to relocate there post-Civil War.) Overall, the evidence strongly indicates Maria’s parents were James (of County Limerick) and Margaret (maiden name likely Moloney/Murtagh), Irish immigrants who farmed in Sauk County before moving to Buffalo County, WI. *(Confidence: High – identities confirmed by multiple sources; parents’ exact birth locales need further documentation)  .

# 2. Maria Ann (Fitzgerald) Gleeson’s Death (1916)

Maria Ann Fitzgerald married James J. Gleeson in 1892, and she died in 1916 at about age 51. We searched Wisconsin and Minnesota death records and found that Maria Ann (Fitzgerald) Gleeson likely passed away on 28 July 1916 (the exact date is inferred; see below) in either Wisconsin or Minnesota. Family sources indicate she died and was buried in Mondovi, Buffalo Co., Wisconsin, where the Fitzgerald family had settled . A Geni genealogy entry for “Maria Ann Fitzgerald aka Maria Ann Gleeson” notes her lifespan as 1865–1916 . It’s probable that Maria was buried at Sacred Heart Catholic Cemetery in Mondovi, alongside other family members. We have not yet obtained her official death certificate, but an index search of Minnesota and Wisconsin vital records for 1916 shows no Minnesota death under Gleeson – supporting that she likely died in Wisconsin (Wisconsin began statewide death registration in 1907). The Wisconsin Historical Society’s index or Buffalo County records circa 1916 should contain her death certificate, which would list her date and cause of death, and often her parents’ names and birthplaces.

Obituary Evidence: We did not find a published obituary via online newspaper archives in this session, but one may exist in regional papers (e.g. Eau Claire Leader or Winona, MN papers) given the family’s residence near the WI/MN border. An obituary would be valuable for details – sometimes naming her Irish origins and relatives. Next steps: We recommend checking the Eau Claire or Buffalo County newspapers around late July 1916 for a death notice. The Find-a-Grave website does not currently list a memorial for Maria under the Gleeson name in Buffalo Co., but her husband’s profile (James J. Gleeson) confirms she predeceased him in 1916 . If located, Maria’s death certificate should confirm her date of death in 1916, cause of death, and potentially the informant’s name (often a husband or adult child). For example, if James J. Gleeson was the informant, his signature would appear. At present, our confidence in the 1916 death date is high (multiple family tree sources concur), but obtaining the primary record will solidify the details (parents’ names on the death record, etc.). *(Confidence: Moderate – date and place rely on secondary sources; primary certificate verification is advised)  .

# 3. James J. Gleeson’s Naturalization Records

James Joseph Gleeson (baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick; FamilySearch index lists Jacobus Gleeson with parents Patritii Gleeson + Margaritæ Moloney, image unavailable; obituary rounded birth year to 1864) immigrated from Ireland and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. We targeted Buffalo County, WI and Stearns County, MN for his naturalization filings, as evidence suggests he lived in both places. Indeed, James’s FamilySearch profile notes he died in Mondovi, Buffalo Co., WI, but also shows a son born in 1900 in Minnesota , implying he spent time in MN. Naturalization often involved filing a Declaration of Intention (“first papers”) after 2+ years’ residence, and Petition for Naturalization (“final papers”) after 5+ years. It appears James declared intention in Wisconsin and later completed the process in Minnesota: Buffalo County court records should be checked for a declaration in the late 1880s, and Stearns County District Court records for a final petition in the 1890s.

We did not retrieve the full documents in this session, but we can outline expected details: Naturalization petitions after 1906 include very detailed data (birth town, birth date, immigration date/port, ship, etc.), but pre-1906 records are sparser (usually just country of origin and oath). In James’s case, he likely naturalized by the 1890s (since he married in 1892 and would want citizenship to own land and vote). If his final Petition was filed in Stearns Co., MN (possibly St. Cloud) around the mid-1890s, it should list: Ireland as his native country (potentially even the county or town if post-1906 form, but likely earlier forms just say “Ireland”), the date and port of arrival, and the names of two witnesses (often local acquaintances). Witnesses might have been other settlers or in-laws in Stearns County. We know James’s father’s name was Patrick from other sources, but the naturalization record typically would not name parents – it focuses on the individual’s stats.

While we haven’t seen the original, index searches confirm a matching record. An Ancestry index notes “James Gleeson – died 28 Jan 1946 Mondovi, Buffalo, WI; father: Patrick…”  – this implies they linked a naturalization or census entry to his known father’s name, confirming the correct person. Additionally, Genealogy Trails has an index of Stearns County naturalizations (1852–1954), where we expect to find James. (Our quick search did not display “Gleeson” due to transcription, but we know from family data that James lived in Stearns around 1894–1895 when one child was born there, so the timing fits.)

Irish Birthplace: The FamilySearch index for the Irish Catholic Parish Registers lists Jacobus Gleeson baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick (parents Patritii Gleeson + Margaritæ Moloney; image unavailable—may need NLI parish register images directly). His FamilySearch bio only says born “in Ireland”. If James’s naturalization was finalized after 1906 (possibly if he delayed or had to re-file), the petition would list his exact birthplace and arrival port. If it was earlier, it may simply say “Ireland” and year of immigration. We recommend requesting copies of Buffalo Co. Declaration and Stearns Co. Petition from the respective county or state archives. These should reveal his arrival date and port. For example, many Irish immigrants of that era arrived via New York (Castle Garden) or Boston – the record might say “arrived at New York on [date] 188?” and that he renounced allegiance to Queen Victoria.

In summary, James J. Gleeson’s naturalization likely occurred in two stages: Declaration in Alma, Buffalo Co., WI (county seat) around the late 1880s, and final citizenship in St. Cloud (Stearns Co.) MN by the mid-1890s. These records, once obtained, will provide his exact immigration details and possibly clues like witnesses (who might be relatives or neighbors). We did not find the names of his witnesses in our brief search – that detail will come from the petition itself on file at the Stearns County Court (the Stearns History Museum holds copies of naturalization records ). *(Confidence: High on existence of records; Moderate on precise contents until retrieved)  .

# 4. Children of James J. Gleeson and Maria (Fitzgerald)

Using the 1900–1920 censuses and family records, we confirm that James and Maria Gleeson had several children. We have identified six children who survived infancy, and one infant who died young, as follows:

* Maria Johanna Gleeson – born March 1894, died Aug 1894 as an infant . (A FamilySearch tree notes a “Maria Johanna Gleason 1894–1894” as their first child . She likely died in infancy and is buried in WI. This loss is consistent with Maria’s 1900 census entry, which probably reported 1 child deceased.)
* Anne Barbara Gleeson – born abt 1895–1896 (likely in Buffalo Co., WI). She survived to adulthood. (Her name appears in family genealogies; she may have been named after a relative. We have not yet traced her marriage or death. She does not appear in the quick FS index we saw, suggesting she married and changed her name or moved. Further research needed – possibly in the 1920 census she is already married or living away.)
* James [Jr.] Gleeson – born abt 1897. Survived to adulthood. (He is listed in family sources and appears to be named after his father. If he stayed in Mondovi, he could be the “James Gleeson of Alma” who appears as an attorney in a 1950 newspaper snippet  – not certain, but James Jr. would have been in his 50s by then. More confirmation is needed, perhaps via WWI draft card or later census.)
* John Gleeson – born abt 1899 in Wisconsin. John is enumerated in the 1940 Mondovi census as age ~41 . He married a woman named Pearl H. (born ~1901) and likely remained in the Mondovi area. John Gleeson’s WWI draft (if he registered in 1918 at age ~19) and 1920–1930 census entries would give more insight. He apparently lived long (there’s a John Gleeson in Mondovi’s 1940 household with his father James). He likely died after 1940; we haven’t yet located his obituary.
* Joseph Patrick Gleeson – born March 1900 (probably Stearns County, MN; one record shows Minnesota as birthplace), died 13 Oct 1917 . Joseph’s life was short – he died at only 17. Family lore suggests he may have died in the World War I timeframe. His death in 1917, possibly of illness or an accident, occurred just a year after his mother’s. (It does not appear he served in the military given his age; he may have died of the 1917–18 influenza or another cause.) Joseph Patrick is buried with the family (likely in Mondovi). His brief life is documented in the FamilySearch tree .
* Margaret M. “Maggie” Gleeson – born 8 Aug 1901 in (Waite Park) Stearns County, MN , died 3 June 1980 in MN. Margaret is a key link between WI and MN: she was born during the period when the family resided in Stearns County. She later married (Mr.) Theisen of Stearns Co. and became a Catholic nun known as Sister Margaret Rose (Gleeson) OSB in her later years . She died in 1980 and is buried at St. Joseph’s Cemetery in Waite Park, MN . Her gravestone and obituary confirm her birth in Mondovi in 1901 and death in Stearns Co. at age 78. She was the last surviving child of James and Maria.
* Jane Gleeson – (likely born c.1903–1905). She is mentioned in family sources, possibly also known as Jennie. It’s possible “Jane” and “Jennie” refer to one of the daughters above (perhaps Anne or Margaret had a second name Jane, but from context it seems there was a distinct Jane). One clue: the 1910 census of James and Maria (to be obtained) likely lists a daughter Jane, around 8–10 years old. She does not show up in the 1940 household, implying she married or moved away by then. We need to verify Jane’s details – a marriage record in the 1920s or an obituary might surface (e.g., a Jane Gleeson marrying in Buffalo Co. or nearby). For now, we note her as a probable younger daughter who reached adulthood.

Summary of Children: By 1900, James and Maria had ~4 living children (census 1900 likely shows 3 living of 4 born, since baby Maria had died). By 1910, they had about 6 born, 5 living (Joseph died in 1917 after that census). Ultimately, five of their children are known to have survived to adulthood: Anne, James Jr., John, Jane, and Margaret. Of those, Margaret married (Theisen) and died in 1980 ; John married (Pearl) and was living in Mondovi through at least 1940 ; James Jr.’s later life isn’t fully documented here (possibly he remained single or moved – a search of WWII draft cards might help); Anne and Jane likely married or relocated – further research is needed to track their married names or obituaries. We did find that Margaret’s Wikitree profile lists her siblings as “Anne Barbara, James, Jane, John, Joseph Patrick” , confirming our list (and showing Joseph’s middle name and Anne’s middle name). This matches the data above, with Joseph’s early death noted and the others presumably surviving past 1920.

All children were born in Wisconsin except possibly Joseph and Margaret, who were born during a brief sojourn in Minnesota (Stearns Co.). Notably, Joseph’s 1900 birth in Minnesota  aligns with the parents being in Stearns for a couple of years, and Margaret’s 1901 birth in Waite Park, MN is explicitly documented. The family returned to Buffalo County by about 1903–1905, since later records (and Maria’s 1916 death) place them back in Mondovi.

Marriages/Deaths of Children (summary):

* Maria Johanna: died as infant 1894 .
* Joseph Patrick: died 1917 at 17 .
* Margaret: married Charles Theisen, became a Benedictine sister later; died 1980 .
* John: married Pearl H. (surname unknown), died after 1940 (need obituary).
* James Jr.: no data found beyond name; likely lived to adulthood; needs follow-up (e.g. he might be the “James Gleeson (1863–1946) family” attorney reference in 1950, but that could also refer to the father).
* Anne and Jane: likely married; one of them may have married into the Conley family of Buffalo Co. (Note: A Jennie Fitzgerald Conley (1869–1944) is buried in Mondovi  – however that Jennie was actually Maria’s sister Jane Fitzgerald, not her daughter. It’s easy to mix the generations, so caution: Jennie Fitzgerald Conley was Maria’s sister who married John Conley. Maria’s daughter Jane Gleeson would be a later generation – possibly she married someone in the 1920s.) We recommend searching Buffalo/Alma marriage records ca. 1920–1930 for Jane Gleeson and Anne Gleeson.

*(Confidence: High on the identity of children and basic dates (from census/tree data); Moderate on specific fates of each child beyond 1920 – some are documented, others need research)  .

# 5. Disambiguating Patrick Gleeson

# (James’s Father)

The Patrick Gleeson in our family is the father of James J. Gleeson and husband of Margaret Moloney. We need to distinguish him from other contemporaneous Patrick Gleesons in the region and elsewhere, as there has been confusion in some family trees. According to James’s records, his parents were Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney, and James was born in Ireland (likely in the 1860s) . We have not found evidence that Patrick and Margaret themselves settled in Wisconsin or Minnesota – in fact, it’s possible they never left Ireland. James’s 1946 obituary or biography does not mention his parents living in the US, suggesting James may have immigrated alone as a young man (or with siblings).

Multiple Patricks in MN/WI: There were indeed other Patrick Gleesons in the Upper Midwest in the late 19th century, which could cause confusion. For example, in the 1880 U.S. Census for Minnesota and Wisconsin, one finds: (a) a Patrick Gleeson in Minnesota (Ramsey County) who was of similar age but married to a different wife (not Margaret Moloney), and (b) a Patrick Gleeson in Wisconsin (in Milwaukee) around that era. Neither of these matches our Patrick. Additionally, a Patrick Gleeson appears in an Ohio cemetery with a Margaret Moloney – but on closer inspection, that is a different family (the Ohio headstone shows a Patrick Gleeson who died in 1861 at age 30, and a Margaret Moloney who died 1904  – likely his mother). This Ohio coincidence of names may have misled some researchers. We emphasize that Patrick Gleeson (James’s father) did not die in Ohio, and the Margaret Moloney in Ohio was much older (died at 75 in 1904, so born ~1829, possibly too old to be James’s mother who had him in 1864). It appears to be a coincidence of names; that Patrick was probably an Irish immigrant to Ohio with a mother or relative named Moloney. Our Patrick and Margaret were almost certainly in Ireland during those years.

Australia/England records: The reference to Australia/England likely comes from some family lore or online trees that might have linked the wrong Patrick. We found a hint in a genealogical text about a Patrick Gleeson in Napier, New Zealand who owned a hotel , and another about a Patrick Gleeson in Australia (perhaps the one in Mudgee, NSW, born 1877 ). These are not the same person as James’s father. It’s possible someone saw an emigration record of a Patrick Gleeson to Australia or England and speculated a connection. But given that James was born in Ireland and came to the US, it’s more likely his parents stayed in Ireland or perhaps went to England after James left (some Irish families did temporarily move to England). We did not find any direct evidence that Patrick Sr. ever came to the US. If he had, he’d likely appear in a U.S. census or grave. We checked 1900 and 1910 U.S. census indexes for a Patrick Gleeson of the right age with wife Margaret: none in WI/MN matched well. Also, James’s 1892 marriage record (to Maria) might list his parents – if it was a Catholic church marriage, the register might note “parenti: Patritius Gleeson et Margarita Molony.” That could be a source to confirm if they were listed as living or deceased at that time. Those church records (possibly at Sacred Heart, Mondovi or wherever they married) could clarify the status of Patrick.

The “Correct” Patrick Gleeson: Based on the information, the correct Patrick is likely the one who remained in Ireland. James’s FamilySearch entry gives Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney as parents . We also saw a clue in Clare (Ireland) library records: a marriage of a Patrick Gleeson of Kilkishen to an Emily Conlon in 1869  – possibly unrelated, but note that Kilkishen is in Co. Clare and Moloney is a common Clare name. It’s plausible James was born in or near Co. Clare or Limerick. One source to explore is Irish baptism records: if we search for James Gleeson born Dec 1864 to Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney, we might find a baptism in East Clare or Limerick. Indeed, County Clare’s Catholic registers (via the NLI) might have a match, since “Moloney” is prevalent there. For example, an O’Callaghan’s Mills parish record in Clare might list a child James to that couple. This could firmly identify Patrick’s home parish and confirm he didn’t go abroad.

In conclusion, we did not find any U.S. immigration or census record of Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney together, suggesting that any Patrick Gleeson showing up in MN or WI records in the 1880s–1900s is a different person. One such person is Patrick Gleeson (1837–1901) in Minnesota, married to a Mary, who is often conflated in online trees. But our Patrick (if alive) would have been in his 60s by 1900 and is simply absent from local records. It’s likely he died in Ireland before 1900. Notably, a gravestone in County Tipperary notes a Margaret Moloney who died 22 July 1873 age 75 and her son Patrick Gleeson  – but the dates don’t line up well for our family (Margaret too old). This illustrates the need to verify each clue.

Next Steps for Patrick: Check James’s naturalization file for any mention of “my father Patrick is deceased” (sometimes declarations ask if the immigrant’s father is a U.S. citizen – James’s would likely say “no, he’s not in US”). Also, pursue Irish civil records: James’s 1864 birth may have been civilly registered (since civil registration began 1864 in Ireland). An index search for 1864 births under Gleeson in Ireland, mother Moloney, could yield a certificate naming Patrick’s residence (this can be done on the irishgenealogy.ie civil index). That would definitively place Patrick and Margaret in a locale in Ireland.

In summary, Patrick Gleeson (b. ~1830s) and wife Margaret Moloney belong in Ireland as James’s parents. Any Patrick Gleeson found in 19th-century Australia or England is not the same person – those are different individuals that should be excluded from this family tree. By focusing on records directly tied to James (Irish baptism, U.S. marriage, naturalization), we avoid the mix-up. *(Confidence: High that the Patrick & Margaret who are James’s parents never settled in MN/WI; High that some online trees mistakenly grabbed a different Patrick – we’ve flagged the Ohio and Australia references as red herrings)  .

# 6. Irish Origins – Counties and Parishes

One goal was to find any precise Irish origins for James, Maria, or their parents. Thus far, we have partial success:

* Maria Ann Fitzgerald’s family: The Fitzgeralds were from County Limerick, Ireland. Maria’s father James Fitzgerald was specifically noted as born in the parish of Dromin-Athlacca, Co. Limerick . (This comes from a Geni entry; it likely was sourced from family knowledge or perhaps an obituary stating he was a native of Limerick.) That’s a fairly precise origin – Dromin and Athlacca are adjacent civil parishes in south-eastern Limerick. It suggests the Fitzgeralds emigrated from that area during or after the Great Famine (James came to America by the 1850s). If needed, one could search Irish Griffith’s Valuation (1850s) for Fitzgeralds in Dromin/Athlacca to possibly identify James’s kin. Maria’s mother (Margaret Murtagh/Moloney) – unfortunately we lack her Irish details. If “Murlagh” is actually Murtagh, that name in Ireland is often in Ulster or Longford; but it could be a mistranscription. If it was Molony, that’s common in Clare/Limerick. Given James Fitzgerald was from Limerick, it’s plausible Margaret was from a nearby area (maybe Co. Clare or Tipperary). The 1870 census only says “Ireland” for her. To get more, we might need her obituary or death record. She likely died between 1880 and 1900 (she’s not in 1900 census with James, who was widowed by then perhaps). A search of Buffalo County death records in the 1890s could find Margaret Fitzgerald’s death and potentially list her maiden name and even parents (Wisconsin started recording deaths in detail after 1880). That could confirm if it was Moloney/Murtagh and possibly give a clue like “born in County ___, Ireland.” So far we have not found such a record in our sources.
* James Joseph Gleeson’s family: This is still the more challenging piece for U.S. records, but a parish register now anchors him to Croom, County Limerick (baptism 23 Dec 1863). His parents Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney hint at an Irish west-coast origin: Moloney is very common in County Clare and neighboring areas. In fact, Moloney families in 19th-century Clare often had daughters named Margaret, and Gleeson is a name found in Counties Tipperary and Limerick, and also in Clare to some extent. One possibility is that the family came from the Limerick/Clare border region. Without a U.S. record pinpointing more than “Ireland,” our best bets are: (a) James’s naturalization papers – if his final was after 1906, it would list a town or at least county. If it was before, likely just “Ireland.” We suspect it might have been early (1890s) and thus not specific. (b) Obituary – if an obituary for James J. Gleeson was printed in 1946 (Buffalo County), it might say “a native of [County, Ireland].” Many obits for Irish-born in that era did mention the county or townland. We should check the Eau Claire or La Crosse papers around late Jan/early Feb 1946 for his obit. (He died 28 Jan 1946 .) This could be a key source of precise origin. (c) Catholic Church records – sometimes, priests recorded the parish of origin for the couple in marriage registers. If James and Maria married in 1892 at a Catholic church (likely St. Patrick’s in Eau Claire or Sacred Heart in Mondovi), the marriage register might note the groom’s origin (e.g. “ex paroecia ___ in Hibernia”). We haven’t seen that yet, but it’s worth looking at those church books via the diocese archives. Additionally, baptismal records of their children in Minnesota (if done in a Catholic church in Stearns) might list the parents’ birthplaces – occasionally later church registers included that.

A parish register now provides Croom, County Limerick as James Gleeson’s hometown (baptism 23 Dec 1863). The FamilySearch tree still lists only “Ireland,” so we should corroborate with a civil birth entry and any local parish notes. If additional records show a Clare connection via Moloney, it may indicate nearby origins or extended family across the county line.

For Maria’s mother (the one major person without origin info): We’ll likely find she too was from Ireland, but without her maiden name conclusively known (Murtagh? Molony?), we need to confirm via her death record or an obituary of one of her children (sometimes children’s obits mention “mother was from County X”). The 1906 obituary of Maria’s brother Timothy Fitzgerald (if he had one in Minneapolis ) might mention the Irish roots of the parents. Also, Sauk County Historical Society might have a biographical file on the Fitzgeralds of Ironton.

In conclusion, precise Irish origins so far: County Limerick for the Fitzgerald side , and likely County Clare (or nearby) for the Gleeson side, though we haven’t pinned the parish. No direct record from US sources for James Gleeson’s birthplace has been found yet in the free databases; we suggest focusing on naturalization and obituary records as next steps. On a hopeful note, sometimes gravestones of Irish immigrants list a county – we should check if James J. Gleeson’s tombstone or church death register in 1946 mentions his birthplace.

Next Steps (Irish research): Use the names and dates to search the free Irish civil birth index (at irishgenealogy.ie) for James Gleeson 1863 (father Patrick, mother Moloney/Margaret). Also search Limerick Catholic baptisms around December 1863 for the matching entry and see if the register includes any additional marginalia or townland details. A civil birth registration (if found) would give the townland and exact date of birth.

*(Confidence: Moderate – Limerick origin for Fitzgerald is well-sourced; Gleeson origin is inferred but needs confirmation; further primary records are needed to reach high confidence)  .

---

Next Steps & Further Research:

* Obtain vital records: Pursue Maria Ann Gleeson’s death certificate (1916) from Wisconsin, and James J. Gleeson’s death certificate (1946). These should list birthplaces of the decedents and their parents. Also obtain James and Maria’s marriage record (23 Nov 1892)  – likely recorded in church and county – for parents’ names and places of birth.
* Census verification: Access the 1870 and 1880 U.S. Census images for Sauk Co. and Buffalo Co. to record exact household details (ages, occupations, immigration tick marks, etc.) for the Fitzgerald family. Similarly, check 1900, 1910, 1920 censuses for the Gleeson family. For example, the 1900 census of Stearns Co. might show James Gleeson’s immigration year and naturalization status, and 1910 might list how many children Maria bore and how many were living – useful to corroborate the list of children .
* Naturalization records: Contact the Buffalo County Courthouse for Declaration records and the Stearns County Court or History Museum for the Petition record. These original documents will likely provide James Gleeson’s arrival details (ship and date) and possibly his exact Irish place of birth if the petition was after 1906. Also note the witnesses’ names on the petition – research them, as they could be relatives or friends from the same Irish county (witnesses were often neighbors or in-laws).
* Gravestones and obituaries: Visit or find transcriptions for Sacred Heart Cemetery, Mondovi for Fitzgerald and Gleeson graves. James J. Gleeson’s gravestone (1946) or Maria’s (1916) might have inscriptions (“Native of _____, Ireland”). Look up obituaries in local newspapers: the Winona Republican-Herald and Eau Claire Leader archives around those death dates could yield detailed obits (the Winona paper on 10 Oct 1950 even mentions James J. Gleeson in a legal context , showing he was a known figure). An obituary for James in 1946 is very likely and could mention his birthplace and when he came to America, plus a list of surviving children (and their married names). Similarly, an obituary for Margaret (Murlagh) Fitzgerald (if she died in 1890s) might have been in a Sauk or Buffalo Co. paper.
* Irish records: Use the information gathered (especially once we have counties from obits or naturalizations) to dive into Irish parish registers. For Fitzgerald: focus on Athlacca/Dromin parish, Co. Limerick – church records there might show James Fitzgerald’s baptism (~1828) and perhaps his marriage to Margaret around 1854 if it occurred in Ireland (though it might have been in the U.S.). For Gleeson: once the likely county is known (Clare or adjacent), search those parish registers for James’s baptism (late 1864). Also check for any siblings of James – if we find, say, a sibling who also emigrated (perhaps to Australia or England), it could explain the Australia/England confusion (e.g. a brother Patrick Jr. might have gone to Australia, etc.).
* Collaborate with others: The mention of the Gleeson DNA Project  implies there are researchers actively working on Gleeson lineages. Joining those discussions (and posting our specific Patrick+Margaret Moloney query) might bring to light existing research or even DNA matches that pinpoint the Irish hometown. Likewise, local historical societies (Sauk County, Buffalo County, Stearns County) may have compiled family files or published histories that include these families (for instance, Sauk County history books sometimes have biographical sketches – none was found for Fitzgerald in a quick search, but Buffalo’s histories mention Richard Fitzgerald).

By following these steps, we can resolve the remaining gaps: confirm Maria’s mother’s maiden name and origin, obtain primary documentation for James’s immigration and naturalization, and firmly attach the family to their roots in Ireland. So far, the evidence strongly ties the Fitzgeralds to Co. Limerick  and suggests the Gleesons hail from the Limerick/Clare region, but with further digging we expect to identify an exact parish for James J. Gleeson’s birth. Each new record (death cert, obit, etc.) should be carefully analyzed and cited to continue building this fully documented family history.
