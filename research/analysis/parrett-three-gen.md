## John Anderson Parrett (1859–1938)

### Corrections

| Field | Previous | Corrected |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1920 "widower" status | Unexplained discrepancy | **Census error** — no divorce/death record for Mary Ellen in that period |
| First marriage end | Unclear | Likely **quiet divorce by 1926** (no formal record found, but he remarried Medora Kuldau) |

### New Details

- No Indiana divorce index entry located
- Mary Ellen's obituary still calls her "wife of John" — ambiguous
- Occupation changes (Farmer → Laborer → Cashier → Plasterer) suggest he **sold or lost the farm**
- No deeds found under his name; no sheriff's sale notices found
- Economic factors of 1910s-20s likely drove career shifts

### Still Unknown

- What happened to the farm (foreclosure? sale?)
- Legal status of 1926 Kuldau marriage if no divorce on record

## Adam Amos Parrett (1885–1959)

### Corrections

| Field | Previous | Corrected |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Mary Ann Beeks fate | Unknown (assumed death or divorce) | **Divorced** — she lived until **1981** |
| Children with Mary Ann | Listed as 7 | Research says **2 sons** — needs verification |
| Thompson wives | Suspected sisters | **Confirmed sisters** — both born Cleveland (Nettie 1884, Lillie 1879) |

### New Details

- St. Joseph, Michigan (1906 marriage location) had manufacturing/shipyard jobs — Adam likely working there
- Both Adam and Mary Ann listed Indiana residence on marriage record
- By 1921 Adam was listed as "widower" on census — then married Nettie Thompson
- After Nettie's death (1926), Adam married her sister Lillie
- Both Thompson sisters had been married to other men before Adam

### Mud Lake Drowning (May 13, 1951)

New details from *Columbia City Palladium-Item* (May 15, 1951):

- Boat capsized in Mud Lake (now Nyona Lake), Whitley County
- Younger brother **Glen escaped** by swimming to safety
- Ferry's body recovered at 2:30 a.m., James's at 5:15 a.m.

### Still Unknown

- Divorce date/record for Mary Ann Beeks
- Why listed as "widower" in 1921 if Mary Ann was alive (perhaps shorthand for divorced?)
