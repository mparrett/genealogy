## John Anderson Parrett (1859–1938)

### Corrections

| Field | Previous | Corrected |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1920 "widower" status | Unexplained discrepancy | **Census error** — no divorce/death record for Mary Ellen in that period |

### New Details

- No Indiana divorce index entry located
- Mary Ellen's obituary still calls her "wife of John" — ambiguous
- Occupation changes (Farmer → Laborer → Cashier → Plasterer) suggest he **sold or lost the farm**
- No deeds found under his name; no sheriff's sale notices found
- Economic factors of 1910s-20s likely drove career shifts

### Still Unknown

- What happened to the farm (foreclosure? sale?)
- Legal status of 1926 Kuldau marriage if no divorce on record
