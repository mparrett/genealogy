Below is what I can **verify quickly from public, citable sources** (and where the big inconsistencies are). I’ll separate **(A) what looks well-supported** vs **(B) what is still “tree-level” and needs primary records**.

---

## 1) Elizabeth’s maiden name: **Lisbee** (not Lusby) ✅

A published transcription of **Knox County, Tennessee marriage records** includes this entry:

* **“Mowry, Lewis to Betsy Lisbee — Mch 3”** ([Internet Archive][1])

This is the strongest public evidence in your list, and it explains the confusion:

* **Betsy = Elizabeth**
* **Lisbee** is an uncommon name and is easy to misread/normalize into **Lusby** in later trees.
* The “Mowry / Mowery / Mowrey” spelling also varies in that same record set, which is normal for the period. ([Internet Archive][1])

**Conclusion:** Treat **Lisbee** as the best-supported maiden name unless/until a marriage bond/license image contradicts it.

---

## 2) Lewis R. Mowery + Elizabeth (Betsy Lisbee): the “both died 1859” claim ⚠️

### What I can confirm from public profiles/transcriptions

* The **marriage exists** (above) and anchors them in **Knox County, TN by 1819**. ([Internet Archive][1])

### What I cannot confirm *from primary evidence* in open sources

* **Lewis’s birth (1801), death (1859), and “German immigrant” claim** are *not* confirmed by a primary document in what’s publicly accessible in the open web results here.
* Same for **Elizabeth’s exact death date in 1859**.

### A plausible explanation for the “double death” year (1859)

Texas had recurring **yellow fever epidemics** during that era, including **1859** (statewide). ([Texas State Historical Association][2])
That makes “same-year spouses dying” *plausible*, but **not proven** for this couple without local records (cemetery, probate, church burial register, newspaper).

**Action to verify:** If they were in **Lamar County, Texas** (see below in the Moses/Samuel section), you’d want:

* **Lamar County probate minutes** for 1859
* **cemetery sexton records**
* local newspaper death notices (often brief)

---

## 3) Moses Mansfield Mowery (abt 1822–1904): death year looks solid ✅

Multiple public tree-style sources converge on:

* **Moses Mansfield Mowery** — **died 29 Aug 1904, Lamar County, Texas** ([WikiTree][3])

This date/location appears consistently across WikiTree’s Mowery profiles and summary pages. ([WikiTree][3])

### Wife: Margaret E. Witt (1828–1904) — year is disputed ⚠️

You’ll find **two competing versions**:

**(A) Died 1904 (tree-style sources)**

* Geni lists **Margaret Elizabeth Witt (1828–1904), died in Lamar Co., TX** ([Geni][4])
* FamilySearch summaries also show her as **1828–1904** in relationship text ([FamilySearch][5])

**(B) Died ~1900 (other tree-style sources)**

* WikiTree has her as **“abt. 1829 – abt. 1900”** ([WikiTree][6])

**Conclusion:** The spouse is very likely **a Witt**, but **the 1904 death year is not yet “verified”** without a cemetery marker/photo, death record, or probate.

**Marriage:** WikiTree gives **1845** (location unknown). ([WikiTree][7])
You’ll want a Tennessee county marriage record (likely Knox area or where the Witt family was) to lock it down.

## 4) Samuel S. Mowrey (1867–1904): the middle initial + the 1904 “triple death” ⚠️✅

### Name: “Samuel S.” vs “Samuel H.” (important)

The open-record summaries I can see repeatedly show him as **Samuel H. Mowrey**, not Samuel S.:

* FamilySearch summary: spouse of Effie Mae Coker is **Samuel H Mowrey (1867–1904)** ([FamilySearch][8])
* FamilySearch profile snippet for “Samuel S” also shows **Samuel H Mowrey (1867–1904)** among the children list ([FamilySearch][5])

**Conclusion:** The “S” may be an Ancestry/tree convention, transcription, or a different Samuel. Right now, **H is better-supported than S** in the visible sources.

### Marriage to Effie May Coker ✅

FamilySearch summary gives:

* **Marriage date: 12 June 1897**
* Spouse: **Effie Mae Coker (1878–1958)** ([FamilySearch][8])

### Death in 1904 ✅ (and same date issue)

Several sources converge on **1904** for Samuel (in Lamar County, TX), and at least one explicitly shows **Aug 29, 1904**:

* Geni: **Samuel S Mowry… died Aug 29, 1904 (Lamar Co, Texas)** ([Geni][9])

Notably, Moses is also commonly listed as **29 Aug 1904**. ([WikiTree][3])

**This is the big red flag / big lead:**

* If **Moses and Samuel died the same day (29 Aug 1904)**, that strongly suggests either:

  * a shared event (accident, outbreak, weather incident), **or**
  * duplicated/propagated tree data.

### “Triple death” (Moses + Margaret + Samuel all 1904)

* Moses in 1904 looks strong. ([WikiTree][3])
* Samuel in 1904 looks strong. ([Geni][9])
* Margaret in 1904 is **plausible but disputed**. ([Geni][4])

**Conclusion:** Right now this is best described as a **confirmed double-death year (1904)** plus a **possible third**.

### Cause/circumstances

I did **not** find an open-web obituary/newspaper clipping in the search results that gives causes for the 1904 deaths (those often require newspaper archives, county histories, or a death certificate).

**Best next record for cause:** Texas death certificates / county death register entries.

---

## 5) Mowery vs Mowrey vs Mowry: pattern ✅

Your line shows exactly what we expect in 1800s records:

* 1819 marriage record uses **Mowry** (no “e”) ([Internet Archive][1])
* Other later records show **Mowery / Mowrey** depending on the clerk and the family branch

**Guideline:** Treat these as **the same surname cluster** unless you find evidence of two distinct families living side-by-side.

# Answers to your specific questions

### (1) 1859 double death (Lewis + Elizabeth)

* **Marriage record is strong; deaths are not yet primary-confirmed publicly.** ([Internet Archive][1])
* A statewide context of **Texas yellow fever epidemics including 1859** makes it plausible **if they were in Texas**, but it’s not proof. ([Texas State Historical Association][2])

### (2) 1904 triple death (Moses + Margaret + Samuel)

* **Moses 1904 (Lamar Co, TX): supported across sources** ([WikiTree][3])
* **Samuel 1904 (likely Lamar Co, TX): supported** ([Geni][9])
* **Margaret 1904: disputed** (1904 vs ~1900) ([Geni][4])
* The shared date **29 Aug 1904** for Moses (and sometimes Samuel) is a key lead. ([WikiTree][3])

### (3) Lisbee vs Lusby

* **Lisbee is supported** by the Knox County marriage record transcription. ([Internet Archive][1])
* “Lusby” looks like a later spelling drift/misread, and also appears as a middle name in descendants (which can further confuse trees). ([WikiTree][6])

### (4) Margaret E. Witt — marriage + family

* She is consistently attached as Moses’s wife, but **marriage details are not nailed down in open sources** (WikiTree says married 1845, location unknown). ([WikiTree][7])
* Next step is a **Tennessee marriage record search (county-level)**.

### (5) Samuel’s middle name (“S” stands for what?)

* The strongest visible sources show him as **Samuel H**, not Samuel S. ([FamilySearch][8])
* You’ll need his **1897 marriage record** or **1904 death record** to get the full middle name.

### (6) Mowery vs Mowrey

* Normal historical spelling variation; the same Knox marriage index shows variant forms for the surname cluster. ([Internet Archive][1])

# Best next “high-yield” documents to pull

If your friend wants this **actually verified** (not just corroborated across trees), these are the fastest wins:

1. **Marriage bond/license image (Knox Co, TN) for Lewis Mowry + Betsy Lisbee (3 Mar 1819)**
   Confirms maiden spelling directly.

2. **Texas death records (Lamar County) for:**

   * Moses Mansfield Mowery (d. 29 Aug 1904) ([WikiTree][3])
   * Samuel (H) Mowrey (d. 1904, possibly 29 Aug) ([Geni][9])
     These often list cause of death and informant (which helps confirm identity).

3. **Cemetery marker photos / sexton registers** for Moses / Samuel / Margaret
   (to resolve Margaret’s 1900 vs 1904 conflict).

If you want, I can also do a second pass that focuses specifically on **finding primary-record images** (or archive references) for the **1904 Lamar County deaths**, because that’s where the “same-day” clue is likely to resolve into a real story.
