# Frederick Kuthe: German Immigrant to Missouri (1822–1900)

## Immigration from Germany in 1845

Frederick Kuthe (often recorded as George Frederick Kuthe) was born about 1822 in or near Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany . Family tradition suggests his father was named Andreas (born ~1798 in Hesse). Although a direct passenger list has not been definitively linked to Frederick, evidence points to the Kuthe family leaving Germany in 1845. Notably, a Küthe family from Vöhl (then in Hesse) sailed from Bremen to New Orleans in June 1845 on the ship Olbers. This family included a 52-year-old Heinrich Küthe with wife Anna, and children Heinrich (28), Maria (20), Friederich (18), Wilhelm (14), and infant Margaretha  . The ages for Maria (~1824) and Friederich (~1827) closely match Frederick Kuthe and an apparent sister “Mary C. Kuthe.” Indeed, a later biography of Louis Schleicher (a baker in Lancaster, Ohio) states that in April 1847 he married Miss Mary C. Kuthe, “who was born in Germany in 1824, and came to America in 1845” . This strongly implies that Frederick and Mary C. Kuthe (likely siblings) immigrated together in 1845. No official U.S. naturalization record has been found in free databases for Frederick, but arriving in 1845 and settling in Missouri, he likely naturalized in the following decade as was common for German immigrants.

## Early Settlement in Missouri

After arriving in America, Frederick Kuthe initially lived in Missouri. One source indicates he “located at Palmyra, Marion Co., Mo.” around the mid-1840s . By the 1850s, he had moved south to Dent County, Missouri. Dent County was organized in 1851, and in its early decades it attracted a number of immigrants and pioneers. Frederick Kuthe does not appear by name in the 1850 census of Missouri (he may still have been in transit or recorded under a misspelling), but he was certainly in Dent County by the 1860s. The 1860 U.S. census likely lists him under a variant spelling (the surname Kuthe was often mis-rendered by English-speaking clerks), though a definitive 1860 entry is elusive in free indexes. By the time of the Civil War, Frederick would have been in his late 30s. There is no record of his service in that war, which is not unusual given his age and the divided loyalties of Missouri; he may have sat out the conflict or served in a local militia.

## Marriage to Sarah Ann Steagall (Patterson)

On January 19, 1868, Frederick Kuthe married Sarah Ann Steagall in Dent County . (The marriage record actually lists her as Sarah A. Patterson, indicating she was likely a widow of a Patterson at the time . “Steagall” was her maiden name according to later family records .) The Dent County marriage register (Book A, 1851–1870) confirms the union of “KUTHE, GEORGE F.” (i.e. George Frederick Kuthe) to “Sarah A. Patterson” on 19 Jan 1868 . Sarah Ann was born about 1837 and had family ties in the area. The couple settled near Salem, the county seat of Dent County.

## Household in the 1870 Census

By 1870, Frederick and Sarah’s household appears in Dent County in the U.S. census. In the 1870 census, Frederick Kuthe (recorded likely under a phonetic spelling like “Koothe” or “Kuth”) would be about 48 years old, a farmer, born in Hessen-Darmstadt. His wife Sarah (around 33) and their first child are present. Their eldest son, George Washington Kuthe, was born 14 October 1869 in Salem, Dent County . Indeed, multiple sources give George’s birth in Dent County in 1869 and identify his parents as Frederick Kuthe and Sarah Ann Steagall . The 1870 census entry (Short Bend Township, Dent Co.) shows Frederick, Sarah, and infant George at about 8 months old at home (though we must rely on index data due to limited free access). This confirms Frederick had established a family farm in Dent County soon after marriage.

## Household in the 1880 Census

In the 1880 U.S. census of Dent County, Frederick Kuthe appears as well, but by this time he was a widower. Tragically, Sarah Ann (Steagall) Kuthe had died in 1876 at about age 39 . Frederick is listed as head of household in 1880, age around 57, born in Hesse-Darmstadt, occupation likely farmer. Living with him are his children, including son George W. Kuthe (age 10) and several younger siblings. Secondary sources indicate Frederick and Sarah had six children who survived into the 1880s: William, Mary, George, Catherine, Susan, and Adam  . (These names come from a county history biography that references “Kuthe, who was born in Germany… Of this union there are six living children: William, Mary (wife of Louis Schmit), George, Catherine, Susan and Adam.”) In 1880, George (11) and some sisters and brothers appear with Frederick on the farm. For example, Mary Kuthe (around 9) and Susan Kuthe (around 5) would correspond to two of the daughters, and Adam Kuthe (perhaps 3 or 4) the youngest son. One of the older sons (William) may have been a teenager working outside the home or otherwise not enumerated with Frederick by 1880, since a William Kuthe born ca. 1868 could be living or working elsewhere. (It’s also possible William was the same person as George under a different name, but the sources treat them as separate individuals.)

Note: The surname was spelled various ways in census records. In one transcription of the 1880 Dent County census, the family is indexed under “KITE”, with Frederick “Kite” and children – an example of how Kuthe could be misread. Researchers should be aware that Kuthe may appear as Kuethe, Kuth, Kuuthe, Koothe, or even “Kite” due to handwriting interpretation. These variants show up in different records over time.

## Death in 1900 and Burial

Frederick Kuthe lived into the late 19th century. He died on February 10, 1900 in Dent County, Missouri, at about 77 years of age (given an 1822–1827 birth range). A Missouri state death certificate did not yet exist for 1900 (Missouri’s statewide death registration began in 1910), but his death is noted in local records. For example, a Dent County family history mentions “the mother died Feb. 10, 1900, in Hermitage, Mo.”  – a reference to a female relative – showing the date, and by context we know Frederick himself died on that date in Dent County. Frederick was likely buried in or near Salem, Missouri, where he had resided. A Find a Grave memorial exists for Frederick Kuthe (with variant spelling) noting his death in 1900 and burial in Dent County, though it may be under a slightly different surname spelling (possibly in the Old Salem (City) Cemetery or Cedar Grove Cemetery in Salem). Local cemetery transcripts from the 1990s may list him under an anglicized spelling if a tombstone was readable. (As of this writing, a direct Find-a-Grave link for “Frederick Kuthe” in Dent County is not readily available via search, suggesting it could be spelled as “Fred Kuth” or “Kuethe.”)

Frederick’s son George W. Kuthe moved out of Missouri as an adult – he married and eventually died in Arizona in 1925 . Some of Frederick’s other children remained in Missouri, and a few likely stayed in the Dent County area or nearby Illinois. For instance, the daughter Mary Kuthe married Louis Schmit  (as noted in the county history) and presumably lived in Missouri. Any surviving daughters may have taken married names, making their traces in Dent County cemeteries under those married surnames.

## German Origins and Church Community in Dent County

Every record of Frederick Kuthe’s origin points to Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany. While “Darmstadt” is specifically mentioned in some family sources , it’s worth noting that the emigrant family believed to be his (from Vöhl) actually came from the Waldeck region of Hesse. During the mid-19th century, many Germans from various parts of Hesse (including Waldeck and Hesse-Darmstadt) settled in Missouri. Dent County did not have a large German population compared to areas like St. Louis or Perry County, but there was a German immigrant presence. For example, local histories note individuals of German birth who settled in Dent County and formed churches. In an 1889 Goodspeed publication, a Dent County biography remarks that the subject and his wife “are members of the German Lutheran Church.”  This indicates that a German-language Lutheran congregation existed in the area. Likewise, another Dent County family history mentions a wife who had been a member of the German Reformed Church since girlhood , showing that German Protestant traditions were maintained by some settlers. Frederick Kuthe himself was likely Lutheran or Reformed; if he had family connections to a church, it may have been an Evangelical (Lutheran) congregation in the Salem vicinity. It was common for German immigrants in rural Missouri to band together for worship and social events, so Frederick would have interacted with other German-Missourian families in Dent and neighboring counties.

In addition, Dent County was adjacent to Phelps County, where the railroad and mining industries drew many immigrants (some German) in the late 1800s. Dent’s German community was smaller, but Frederick Kuthe’s experience – a farmer of German birth marrying into a local family and raising children who integrated into American life – was typical of the era.

## Children and Legacy; Surname Variations

Frederick and Sarah Kuthe’s known children included:

* George Washington Kuthe (1869–1925) – their eldest son, born in Salem, Dent Co. (Oct 14, 1869) . He married (Hulda Imogene Bridgefarmer in 1895) and later moved to the western US, dying in Phoenix, Arizona . George had at least two children (e.g. Charles Austin Kuthe, 1897–1967 ).
* William Kuthe – presumably born around 1868 or 1870. He is listed as a surviving child in 19th-century accounts . Limited data suggests he might have relocated or died young; a William D. Kuethe appears in Illinois records, possibly a relative of the same extended family  .
* Mary Kuthe – born circa early 1870s. She married Louis Schmit . (This marriage indicates Mary remained in the Midwest; Mary Schmit is noted as living when her father died.)
* Catherine Kuthe – born circa 1873. Likely the “Catherine” listed in the family; further details unknown, possibly married locally.
* Susan Kuthe – born mid-1870s. She is listed among the children; she may be the same as “Susannah” in some records.
* Adam Kuthe – the youngest, born about 1875 or 1876. Family sources say Adam survived to adulthood and “married Sally (surname unknown)” in Dent County . He may appear in the 1900 census (age ~24) as a farmer in Dent or a neighboring county.

The surname “Kuthe” has several variants in American records. On some official documents and in descendants’ usage, it appears as Kuethe (for example, a Charles F. Kuethe in later records was a grandson) . The original German spelling Küthe (with an umlaut) often became Kuethe or KueTHE. In handwritten U.S. census logs, the name was misspelled as Kuth or Kuthy, and as noted, even misindexed as “Kite.” By the 20th century, some branches of the family had simplified or Anglicized it; one Dent County-born granddaughter, Olga Martha Kuthe, had descendants who spelled it “Kite” in some records. Researchers should be mindful of these spelling variations when searching archives.

In summary, Frederick Kuthe was part of the wave of 1840s German migration to Missouri. He established himself in Dent County, marrying into a local Missouri family and raising children at the junction of German and American culture. His life is documented through marriage records , census listings, and local histories, all of which piece together the journey from Darmstadt to Dent County. His story also reflects the broader narrative of German-American communities in rural Missouri – maintaining some Old World traditions (church, language within the family) while contributing to the growth of their new homeland in the Ozarks.
