## The Canal Era (1837-1873)

### Lagro's Significance

> "In the early times—a few years prior to the civil war only—Lagro was the most widely known and most prosperous town in many counties around."

> "During that period, even before the advent of the Wabash & Erie Canal, which was opened for traffic on July 4, 1837, and up to the time this canal went out of commission in the fall of 1873, Lagro was at her zenith."

> "Grain was hauled to the Lagro market from as far south as the neighborhood of Muncie, and to the north from the vicinity of Crown Point."

### The Wharfs and Commerce

- Two locks approximately 900 yards apart
- Wharfs and elevators built between the locks
- Jesse Barlow was the old paymaster
- Canal office in what later became Rau's meat market

> "The time was when people came to Lagro from Anderson, Marion, Kokomo, Warsaw and other points to do their shopping back in the canal days. Lagro was the greatest trade center in this section of Indiana and many were the times that the writer has seen wagons loaded with grain waiting in line extending beyond the Narrows, waiting their turn to get to the warehouses and wharfs that they might unload their cargos."

### Hotels and Transients

Three hotels with ~120 rooms total:
1. **Keller House** (on the hill) - "had a reputation that extended to New York"
2. **Humboldt House** (Washington Street, near the canal)
3. **Western House** (three-story frame, built 1843)

> "Night, week in and [week out] the rooms were crowded... the overflow was provided with old fashioned pallets put down in the halls. The landlord [covered] the floors with [straw], tacked sheeting down over it and turned the crowds into the rooms, sometimes there being twelve to fifteen sleeping in one room."

### 1876 Business Directory

Even after canal abandonment, Lagro Township had:
- 10 dry goods stores
- 12 blacksmith shops
- 7 grocery stores
- 6 grain houses
- 3 grist mills, 7 saw mills
- 3 hotels, 5 eating houses
- 3 carriage factories
- 2 tanneries
- 4 stave factories
- 10 physicians

Population in 1850s: ~1,200

### Freight Rates (Canal Era)

From the boat *Bullion* cargo manifest:
- 1300 bushels (78,000 lbs): Peru to State Line - $24.96
- 12 barrels whiskey (4,320 lbs): Peru to Lagro - 45¢
- 128 barrels whiskey (45,480 lbs): Peru to Huntington - $7.73

## The Irish Canal Workers

> "If it hadn't been for the Irish the canal might never have been built, for no one but the Irish would have moved all that dirt with pick, shovel and wheelbarrow, and put up with the pestilent conditions that prevailed while the canal was being built."

> "They fought the dirt and mud, the heat and the cold, the rattlesnakes and ague, and when they got tired of that they fought among themselves."

### The "Irish War" Near Lagro

Two factions:
- **Corkonians** - located just east of Lagro
- **Fardowners** - 250 men below Wabash

> "They had differences while working on canals in the east, and when they came to Wabash county they brought their trouble and ill feeling with them."

The Fardowners massed and marched toward Lagro. Chief Godfroy (Miami) offered to mediate but was refused. Militia from Fort Wayne (63 men) and Huntington intervened. Ringleaders arrested, taken to Indianapolis, escaped punishment on technicality.

## The Wabash River

### Historical Significance

> "The Wabash river through Wabash county was thus the most important trade route from east to west. Those who travel Road 24 from Logansport to Toledo, little realize the historic ground they are traveling over."

The Maumee-Wabash portage route (via Fort Wayne) was one of five ancient routes from the northeast to the Mississippi.

### The Feeder Dam

- Built across the river, created a convenient ford
- After canal abandonment, Wabash Hydraulic Co. maintained it for factory water power
- Captain Hunt ran a small steamer up to "Hanging Rock" for excursions and picnics
- Destroyed by 1883 flood and subsequent dynamiting by farmers angry about backwater flooding

## Landscape Description (1835)

> "In 1835 the dense forests of Lagro township abounded in wild honey and were full of wild game, such as bear, deer, wolves, turkey, raccoon, pheasants, rattlesnakes and squirrels."

### Early Settlement

- First house built 1828 by Joseph and Champion Helvey near mouth of Salamonie River
- Small brick house built 1828 for Miami chief LeGros (town's namesake)
- Site was a campsite for trappers/traders traveling between Fort Vincennes and Quebec
- First election 1832: Andrew Jackson 14 votes, Henry Clay 12

---

## The Decline

> "The decadence of Lagro began with the abandonment of the canal in '73"

### Railroad Competition

- Wabash Railroad commenced in Ohio 1854, reached Lafayette by 1856
- Extended to Illinois border by 1857, eventually to St. Louis
- "The railroad was faster and the service was better than the canal"
- Canal abandoned 1873 "except for small local use"

### The Final Blow

> "The loss of the county seat and the coming of railroads opened new shipping points putting Lagro in the background."

The Chicago, Wabash & Michigan railroad was "switched off from Marion and pulled over to Wabash by Calvin Cowgill and other stockholders. This line would otherwise have run through Lagro."

## Post-Canal Infrastructure

### The Plank Road

- Built from Lagro to North Manchester
- Lagro remained "the principal outlet for products for the north part of the county"
- John Comstock built a competing plank road from Liberty Mills to Huntington

## Location Image Direction

**Selected:** Canal wharfs at Lagro, c. 1865-1870

Visual elements:
- Canal boats (carried 35-40 passengers, towed by 2-6 horses)
- Wharfs and grain elevators between the two locks
- Horses on the towpath
- Warehouses
- Possibly grain wagons waiting "beyond the Narrows"

Style: Hand-watercolored engraving (per project conventions for location panels)

**Narrative significance:** John Anderson Parrett (age 6-11 during this period) would have witnessed Lagro's golden age in its final years. By the time he was 14, the canal was abandoned and the world of his childhood had fundamentally changed—mirroring the earlier loss of his father in 1863.
