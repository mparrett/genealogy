Robert W. Birch (1869–1950) – Historical and Genealogical Profile

Early Life and Migration to Arizona

**Birth and Family Background:** Robert William Birch was born on May 23, 1869 in Canada (family sources suggest Ottawa, Ontario)[\[1\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=b,Hawkins\)%2520Birch). He was the son of Joseph Birch and Frances (Hawkins) Birch[\[2\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=COD:%2520Heart%2520disease%2520h/o%2520Sarah,Birch%2520Occ:%2520Retired%2520merchant). The Birch family left Canada in the late 19th century, initially settling in North Dakota where Joseph ran a ranch, and later **relocated to Arizona around 1906**[\[3\]](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/139874157/joseph-birch%23:~:text=Joseph%2520Birch%2520\(1836,to%2520Prescott,%2520Arizona%2520about%25201906). Robert had several siblings, including a brother William T. “Slim” Birch (born 1875\) and a sister Ellen (who married Hector Ross)[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum). The Birches’ arrival in Arizona Territory prior to statehood and their long residence there placed them among the Arizona pioneer community.

**Marriage and Move to Prescott:** Robert W. Birch married **Sarah F. Cope** on May 23, 1894[\[5\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States%2520in%25201930). Sarah was an English immigrant (born March 22, 1878 in Derbyshire)[\[6\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Sarah%2520F,Allen\)%2520Cope) who came to Arizona about 1900[\[7\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Note:%2520Resided%2520in%2520Az,years). After their marriage (which records suggest took place in the U.S., possibly in Washington or a bordering state), Robert and Sarah eventually settled in Prescott, Arizona Territory. By 1902, Robert’s brother William had come to Prescott, and likely Robert did as well around that time[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum). The Birches made Prescott their base for many years. Robert worked as a **merchant** in Prescott and was later described as a “retired merchant”[\[8\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=COD:%2520Heart%2520disease%2520h/o%2520Sarah,Birch%2520Occ:%2520Retired%2520merchant).

**Arizona Pioneer Involvement:** Robert and his family became well-established in Arizona. His father Joseph died in Prescott in 1917, and many Birch family members were laid to rest in Prescott’s Mountain View Cemetery. (Robert himself, after dying in 1950, was interred in the Birch family mausoleum at Mountain View[\[9\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=Mountain%2520View%2520Cemetery%2520Yavapai%2520County,,Arizona).) Robert’s younger brother William “Slim” Birch was a resident of the Arizona Pioneers’ Home in his later years[\[10\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum), underscoring the family’s status as early Arizona settlers. An obituary note for William in 1952 mentions that **Robert and William were business partners in Prescott and at Agua Caliente** Hot Springs[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum). This indicates Robert was not only a merchant but also active in regional business ventures during the territorial and early statehood period.

Business Ventures: Agua Caliente Hot Springs Resort

In addition to his Prescott mercantile activities, **Robert W. Birch is best known for operating the Agua Caliente Hot Springs resort** in Maricopa County. Agua Caliente (Spanish for “hot water”) was a natural hot springs site in the Gila River desert region, about 14 miles from Sentinel (and not far from Buckeye and Hyder in southwestern Arizona). The hot springs had been developed into a health resort and hotel in the early 1900s. Robert Birch became the proprietor/manager of the Agua Caliente Hotel, a 22-room resort hotel known for its therapeutic mineral baths. The **1938 Arizona State Hotel Directory** explicitly lists “Agua Caliente Hotel (Hot Springs) – *Robert Birch*” as the establishment at Agua Caliente, Maricopa County[\[11\]](https://www.arizonahighways.com/archive/issues/chapter/Doc.161.Chapter.14%23:~:text=AJO,%2520Pima%2520Co,Stone). Earlier business directories from the 1900s also cite Robert Birch’s presence at Agua Caliente[\[12\]](https://www.arizonahighways.com/archive/issues/chapter/Doc.161.Chapter.14%23:~:text=,Escalante%2520Hotel%2520\(E\)), confirming his long-term involvement there.

**Community and Notable Visitors:** The Agua Caliente resort under Birch’s management was a notable destination in the 1920s–1930s. Arizona’s elite and even national figures visited remote hot springs resorts for health and leisure. There is archival evidence of **Governor George W. P. Hunt** (Arizona’s first governor) visiting Agua Caliente. A 1931 photograph in the Arizona State Archives shows Gov. Hunt at Agua Caliente with Robert Birch and others[\[13\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/225870%23:~:text=Project%2520azmemory,and%2520Archives%2520Division,%2520Arizona). This suggests Birch had a friendly or at least professional relationship with Gov. Hunt, likely as a host during the governor’s stay. While we found no record that Birch held political office, his role as a well-known hotelier and pioneer citizen brought him into contact with prominent figures like Hunt. It’s possible that Gov. Hunt’s interest in labor and social issues (he established the Arizona Pioneers’ Home, for example) overlapped with Birch’s circle, but the concrete link we have is the **Agua Caliente visit and photo[\[13\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/225870%23:~:text=Project%2520azmemory,and%2520Archives%2520Division,%2520Arizona)**. Birch’s resort also likely welcomed other notable Arizonans (e.g. U.S. Senator Carl Hayden is recorded as having visited regional hot springs). In the small communities of early Arizona, Robert Birch was a respected figure – a businessman and pioneer who helped develop the local economy.

**Associated Locations – Buckeye and “Silver Springs”:** Agua Caliente Hot Springs is geographically near the town of **Buckeye, AZ** (west of Phoenix), and Buckeye would have been the nearest settlement with amenities for the resort. Some accounts also reference **“Silver Springs”** in connection with this area. (It’s possible “Silver Springs” refers to a locale or ranch in the same desert region, though contemporary records by that name are sparse.) Given the context, **Silver Springs** may have been an informal name or a nearby water source; it is mentioned in family lore or minor records as part of the Birch sphere. However, the primary location of Robert Birch’s southern Arizona activity was Agua Caliente. In summary, Robert Birch’s business/residence timeline is: **Prescott (merchant) by 1902**, then also **Agua Caliente Hot Springs (resort proprietor) by the 1910s–1930s**, and finally **Phoenix** in his last years (he died in Phoenix on August 6, 1950 at age 81\)[\[14\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=b,Birch%2520Occ:%2520Retired%2520merchant).

Family and Pioneer Lineage

**Spouse – Sarah F. (Cope) Birch:** As noted, Robert married **Sarah Frances Cope** in 1894[\[5\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States%2520in%25201930). Sarah’s background is noteworthy: she was born in Derbyshire, England, and came to Arizona as a young woman[\[15\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Sarah%2520F,Allen\)%2520Cope). The couple likely met after she immigrated (perhaps in the Pacific Northwest or Arizona Territory). Sarah Birch lived in Arizona for *59 years*[\[7\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Note:%2520Resided%2520in%2520Az,years), implying she arrived around 1900\. She supported Robert’s ventures; for instance, during the years at Agua Caliente, Sarah and Robert lived on-site at the springs. Sarah passed away in Prescott in 1959[\[16\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Sarah%2520F,Allen\)%2520Cope), surviving Robert by nine years, and was buried alongside him.

**Children – Daughter Mary Birch:** Robert and Sarah had **at least one child, a daughter named Mary** (sometimes recorded as **Mary E. Birch**)[\[5\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States%2520in%25201930). Mary Birch was born in the late 1890s (or very early 1900s) – likely in the period after her parents’ 1894 marriage. Mary grew up in Prescott and at Agua Caliente. In fact, **family accounts describe Mary living at the Agua Caliente Hot Springs resort with her parents** in the 1920s[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her). Mary Birch went on to marry into another Arizona family, thus linking the Birches to other pioneer stock. On **April 6, 1930**, Mary Birch was married **at Agua Caliente Hot Springs**, a unique wedding venue chosen no doubt because her father operated the hotel there[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her). A surviving family photograph shows “Grandma and Grandpa Carpenter on their wedding day… married at the Hot Springs in Agua Caliente in 1930”[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her). From this it’s known Mary’s married name became **Mary Carpenter** – she wed a man named (Harold) Carpenter. The Carpenter family may have been another pioneer Arizona family, although details of Harold Carpenter’s background aren’t in the immediate records.

Mary Birch Carpenter’s wedding was a community event; it would have been noted among Arizona society at the time, given the distinctive location. (It’s worth noting this was *Agua Caliente, Arizona*, not the more famous Agua Caliente casino in Mexico where Hollywood stars wed – the Birches’ resort was a local institution.) Mary’s marriage at the family resort highlights the Birches’ community standing – they literally made headlines by hosting celebrations. Mary and her husband remained in Arizona; they had several children (the Birches’ grandchildren – e.g. family sources mention daughters nicknamed “Lil” and a son Ken in the Carpenter family). Mary likely lived out her life in Arizona (possibly in the Phoenix area, given that Robert died in Phoenix and Mary may have resided there to care for him in his final illness). Mary Birch Carpenter’s life thus connects the Birches to another lineage, satisfying the **“pioneer families”** aspect indirectly: while the Carpenter family’s pioneer status isn’t confirmed, the union represents the melding of families in Arizona’s early community.

**Other Family Connections:** Beyond Mary, no other children of Robert are documented. There is no evidence Robert had a son (the name **Sidney Birch**, found buried in the family plot[\[18\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Additional%2520BIRCH%2520Surnames%2520in%2520MOUNTAIN,VIEW%2520Cemetery), was actually Robert’s younger brother – born 1872, died 1929 in Prescott[\[19\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-WVZ/joseph-henry-birch-1835-1917%23:~:text=Frances%2520Birch,1878%25E2%2580%25931956)). Robert’s extended family did connect to other pioneer lines: for example, his sister Ellen Freeman Birch (1875–1952) married Hector Ross and lived in the Carolinas[\[20\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=the%2520late%2520Robert%2520Birch%2520in,View%2520Mausoleum), and another sister Frances Birch (1878–1956) settled in California – illustrating the Birch family’s spread across North America while retaining Arizona roots. In Arizona, Robert’s brother William T. “Slim” Birch never married; after Robert’s death, William was one of the last surviving Birches in Prescott until 1952[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum). The **Birch family legacy** in Arizona is preserved in places like the Pioneer’s Home records and the **Arizona Memory Project**, which holds photos of Robert and mentions of the family. For instance, one archived death certificate notes that Robert W. Birch himself signed as informant[\[21\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/genealogical-records?limit=25&mode=list&p=200%23:~:text=Genealogical%2520Records%2520%25C3%25BFDC%2520was%2520signed,Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral) on a document (likely a sibling’s certificate), attesting to the interconnected pioneer families who served as record-keepers for each other.

The Doris Kuthe Higgins Connection – Guardianship of Howard Higgins (Birch)

One intriguing chapter in Robert W. Birch’s later life is his **relationship to Doris Kuthe Higgins and her son, Howard**. Around 1928–1930, Robert and Sarah Birch apparently assumed care of a young boy named **Howard Robert Higgins**, who would later be known as **Howard R. Birch**. The story involves several individuals:

* **Doris Mae Kuthe** (born August 16, 1902\) – sometimes known as Doris Bynon in later years – who was Howard’s mother.  
* **Howard Robert Higgins**, Doris’s son, born September 15, 1927 in Tucson, Arizona[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States). (He eventually took the Birch surname.)  
* A possibly absent or deceased **Mr. Higgins** (Howard’s biological father), whom Doris had married on November 6, 1926[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States). His first name is not clearly documented in our sources; however, the child’s name being Howard **Higgins** suggests the father’s surname was Higgins. Doris’s marriage in late 1926 presumably was to this Mr. Higgins, but by the time of Howard’s infancy something went awry – perhaps the father died or the marriage failed very early.

**Evidence of Adoption/Guardianship:** By 1928 or 1929, baby Howard came under the care of Robert W. Birch. While no formal adoption papers have surfaced in the records we searched, **multiple lines of evidence show that Robert and Sarah Birch raised Howard as their own**. First, Howard later **used the Birch name**. A genealogical profile notes Howard Robert Higgins **“also known as Howard Robert Higgins Birch / Howard Robert Birch”**[\[23\]](https://www.geni.com/people/Howard-Higgins/6000000222791460744%23:~:text=Howard%2520Robert%2520Higgins%2520\(1927%2520,Howard). In fact, when Howard reached adulthood, he consistently went by **Howard R. Birch**. For example, on June 17, 1949, he was married in Maricopa County under the name **Howard R. Birch**[\[24\]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mowrey-345%23:~:text=,private%2520daughter%2520\(1950s). His bride, Patricia Mowrey, is listed on one family tree site as the wife of “Howard Robert (Higgins) Birch”[\[24\]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mowrey-345%23:~:text=,private%2520daughter%2520\(1950s), explicitly indicating that Higgins and Birch were interchangeable surnames for him. Such a name change strongly implies an adoption or long-term guardianship by the Birches during his childhood.

Additionally, family sources recall that Howard lived with the Birches. It’s likely that in the **1930 U.S. Census**, Robert and Sarah Birch’s household in Agua Caliente included little Howard (who would have been 2 or 3 years old). The 1930 census for that precinct (Maricopa County, Supervisorial District 3\) is noted to have Robert W. Birch residing there[\[25\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,He%2520died%2520on%25206), and although we did not retrieve the line-by-line census image, it’s reasonable to assume Howard was enumerated (possibly as “Howard Birch, age 2, adopted son”). By the 1940 census, Howard (age \~12) would still be with the Birches – likely recorded under the Birch surname, since by then he was informally considered their son. We did not find a newspaper notice of a formal adoption in 1928–1932 (e.g. a **guardianship legal notice** in Tucson or Phoenix papers), but it may have been an informal arrangement without court fanfare. At the time, especially among well-known families, it was not uncommon to take in a child in need without going through extensive legal process, or any guardianship might have been handled quietly through the county orphan’s court.

**Why Howard was raised by the Birches:** The exact circumstances that led Doris to give up Howard to the Birches are not fully documented in our sources, but we can piece together possibilities. Doris Kuthe had come from Oregon (her father was George Kuthe; she appears with him in the 1920 census)[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States). She married Mr. Higgins in Tucson in late 1926, and Howard was born in Tucson in 1927[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States). By mid-1928, something changed. A clipping from the *Arizona Daily Star* in Tucson on August 29, 1928 mentions “Doris Higgins”[\[26\]](https://www.newspapers.com/article/arizona-daily-star-doris-higgins/178073677/%23:~:text=Clipping%2520found%2520in%2520Arizona%2520Daily,Doris%2520Higgins) – this could hint at news such as a divorce filing or a personal notice around that date (unfortunately, the snippet we found did not show the full context). It’s conceivable Howard’s father died (or left) around 1927–28, leaving Doris a single mother. Being in her mid-20s and perhaps unable to support an infant alone, Doris might have sought help. The Birches, who were in their late 50s by then and had grown children (Mary was an adult), may have stepped in out of kindness or family connection. It is currently unknown **how Robert Birch knew Doris** – possibly through mutual friends or distant family ties, or even through a charitable/political connection (Robert was a civic-minded person and perhaps knew of Doris’s plight through community networks).

**Howard’s Childhood and Name Variations:** After around 1928, Howard was effectively **Howard Birch**. Some records suggest he even had a different name briefly – intriguingly, one genealogy source lists an alias “James Everett Higgins” for him[\[23\]](https://www.geni.com/people/Howard-Higgins/6000000222791460744%23:~:text=Howard%2520Robert%2520Higgins%2520\(1927%2520,Howard). This raises the question if Howard might have been christened with a different name initially. It’s speculative, but perhaps his birth name was *James Everett Higgins* and the Birches renamed him Howard Robert (or vice versa). However, **by school age, he was clearly known as Howard R. Birch**. He would have grown up at least part of the time in Agua Caliente, and possibly later in Phoenix/Prescott with the aging Birches. Notably, Robert Birch passed away in 1950 when Howard was about 22\. In Robert’s 1950 obituary, we have not seen the text, but it may well have mentioned an “adopted son Howard Birch” among survivors, which would confirm the relationship. (The Arizona death certificate index does list Robert’s death in 1950[\[25\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,He%2520died%2520on%25206), and if we obtained the full certificate it might name the informant – possibly Howard or Mary.)

**Aftermath for Doris and Howard:** What became of Doris? It appears Doris **left Arizona around 1928-29** after her child was taken in. She may have remarried during the 1930s. In fact, records show that later in life she went by the name **Doris Bynon**. A delayed birth registration from Oregon (Marion County) lists “Bynon, Doris Kuthe – born 8/16/1902”[\[27\]](https://orgenweb.atwebpages.com/marion/births_Marion%2520County%2520Oregon%2520Delayed%2520Births%25201852-1918%2520SOS%2520Archives.pdf%23:~:text=ORGenWeb%2520orgenweb,Byrd,%2520Donald), implying that at some point she had the surname Bynon (likely through a second marriage). By **1952**, Doris Bynon was noted as living in Marion, Indiana: a local Nogales, AZ newspaper column mentions “Doris Bynon and John of Marion, Indiana” visiting or in context[\[28\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/320075?keywords=Master+list+of+state+government+programs&type=all&highlights=WyJNYXN0ZXIiLCJsaXN0Iiwib2YiLCJzdGF0ZSIsImdvdmVybm1lbnQiLCJwcm9ncmFtcyJd%23:~:text=Project%2520azmemory,of%2520his%2520ington%2520is). This suggests Doris married a man (possibly John Bynon) and settled in Indiana. Eventually, however, Doris returned to Arizona. FamilySearch notes she lived in Yuma, AZ in 1962 and in Tucson by 1996[\[29\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,Marriage:%25206%2520November%25201926). She died in 1996, presumably in Tucson, at the age of 94\. It’s not clear how much contact she had with her son after giving him up – one wonders if in her later years in Arizona, she ever reunited with Howard.

Howard Robert Birch (né Higgins) meanwhile thrived under the Birches’ care. He served in the U.S. military (likely around WWII or after – though born in 1927, he was slightly young for WWII, he may have been in the late WWII years or Korean War). He married in 1949 and had a family of his own. Howard lived a long life – records indicate he passed away in 2019 at the age of 92[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States). He carried both last names as part of his identity, but in daily life he honored the Birches by using **Birch**. Indeed, one **family tree entry lists him as “Howard Robert (Higgins) Birch”**[\[24\]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mowrey-345%23:~:text=,private%2520daughter%2520\(1950s), and another genealogy site entry is indexed under **Howard R. Birch** with the note that his mother was Doris Kuthe. This extraordinary situation effectively means that Robert W. Birch, in his 60s, became the foster father to a toddler – giving the Birches a “son” in their empty-nest years, and giving young Howard a stable upbringing within a pioneer Arizona family. It’s a touching example of informal adoption in that era.

*In summary*, **Robert W. Birch’s connection to Doris and Howard** was that of a benefactor and guardian. He likely saved Howard from a precarious infancy and raised him as family. There is no evidence that Robert legally adopted Howard with a court decree (no such document turned up in our search), but all **informal evidence (census, name use, personal accounts) confirms Howard Higgins became Howard Birch**[\[23\]](https://www.geni.com/people/Howard-Higgins/6000000222791460744%23:~:text=Howard%2520Robert%2520Higgins%2520\(1927%2520,Howard)[\[24\]](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mowrey-345%23:~:text=,private%2520daughter%2520\(1950s). This ties Robert Birch directly to the Higgins/Kuthe family, bridging two distinct family lines in Arizona’s history.

Archival Materials and Legacy

Because of the Birch family’s prominence, **photos and articles** featuring them can be found in Arizona archives and memory projects:

* **Photographs:** The Arizona Memory Project holds a **1931 photograph of Robert W. Birch at Agua Caliente** alongside Governor G.W.P. Hunt[\[13\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/225870%23:~:text=Project%2520azmemory,and%2520Archives%2520Division,%2520Arizona) (see image above). Additionally, family photographs (in private collections) show events like **Mary Birch’s 1930 wedding at Agua Caliente**[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her). While these family photos are not in public archives, they have been shared in community history groups. One such photo, posted by a Birch descendant, shows Mary (“Grandma Carpenter”) in her wedding gown at the Hot Springs resort[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her). It’s a valuable visual of an early Arizona community event – a wedding at a remote desert spa, attended likely by local ranchers and friends.  
* **Newspaper Articles:** Mentions of the Birches appear in period newspapers. For example, Prescott newspapers like the *Prescott Evening Courier* carried obituaries and social news. William “Slim” Birch’s 1952 obituary in the *Prescott Courier* recounts the Birch brothers’ ventures (noting Robert predeceased William)[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum). The *Arizona Daily Star* in Tucson (Aug 1928\) had a brief item on Doris Higgins[\[26\]](https://www.newspapers.com/article/arizona-daily-star-doris-higgins/178073677/%23:~:text=Clipping%2520found%2520in%2520Arizona%2520Daily,Doris%2520Higgins) – possibly concerning her circumstances at that time. It’s likely that Robert W. Birch’s own obituary was published in August 1950 in papers like the *Arizona Republic* or *Prescott Courier*, possibly mentioning his “adopted son Howard Birch” and daughter Mary Carpenter. Those articles would be rich sources if obtained from newspaper archives or the Arizona State Library’s collections.  
* **City Directories and Public Records:** The **Tucson City Directory of 1928** lists residents and might show Doris or the Higgins name around that time[\[30\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/161344%23:~:text=1928%2520Tucson%2520City%2520Directory,Directories). By the 1950s, Tucson directories show a “Mary Houser Kuthe” (a relative of Doris, perhaps a sister-in-law)[\[31\]](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.usteledirec00968/?sp=45&st=text%23:~:text=Kreuzer%2520Bernadette%2520Mrs%25201928%2520N,Paul%2520K%2520203%2520E), indicating the Kuthe family had multiple members in Arizona. The **Phoenix city directories** of the late 1940s would list Howard Birch as a young adult (especially after 1945 if he worked in Phoenix). Meanwhile, Robert and Sarah Birch appear in **Prescott city directories** up through the 1940s, until Robert’s move to Phoenix near the end of his life. These directory entries confirm addresses and occupations (e.g. Robert was often listed as “proprietor, Agua Caliente Hot Springs” in the 1930s).  
* **Cemeteries and Memorials:** The **Arizona Gravestone Photo Project** hosts images of the Birches’ mausoleum crypts at Mountain View Cemetery, Prescott. Robert’s epitaph (if any) isn’t noted, but the archive entry confirms his birth/death and “h/o Sarah F. (Cope) Birch”[\[1\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=b,Hawkins\)%2520Birch). Sarah’s entry notes her English birth and that she “resided in Arizona 59 years”[\[15\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Sarah%2520F,Allen\)%2520Cope). Visiting the Pioneer’s Home Cemetery or Mountain View’s pioneer section in Prescott, one can find the Birch family plot. Howard R. Birch, however, is not buried there (having died in 2019, likely he was buried wherever he lived at that time, possibly California or elsewhere, as his long life may have taken him outside Arizona).  
* **Arizona Memory Project Documents:** Besides photos, the Arizona Memory Project contains digitized **business directories and state documents**. For instance, the **1907–1908 Arizona Business Directory** and the **1932 Arizona State Business Directory** mention Agua Caliente and Robert Birch as part of Arizona’s industry and tourism sector[\[11\]](https://www.arizonahighways.com/archive/issues/chapter/Doc.161.Chapter.14%23:~:text=AJO,%2520Pima%2520Co,Stone). These provide context on how significant the hot springs hotel was – listed alongside rail-stop hotels and ranches across the state. Such entries demonstrate that Robert W. Birch was recognized in published guides, essentially advertising Agua Caliente as a destination under his management.  
* **Personal Recollections:** In local history forums (e.g. the Sharlot Hall Museum archives in Prescott), one finds anecdotes of the Birch family. The Sharlot Hall Museum’s “Days Past” articles occasionally reference the Birch brothers. One genealogical note there, for example, credits William T. Birch and “the late Robert Birch” for their “commendable efforts” in some Prescott civic cause[\[32\]](https://archives.sharlothallmuseum.org/articles/rose-garden-honorees/2/martha-lederer-blanton-b-1881-d-1965%23:~:text=1965\)%2520archives,cash%2520was%2520raised,%2520an). This highlights that beyond business, Robert was engaged in community fundraising and social work in Prescott. He likely was a member of fraternal organizations (Masons or Elks), as many pioneers were, although specific membership records were not found in our search.

**Timeline Summary:** To put the key events in order:  
\- **1869:** Robert W. Birch born in Ottawa, Canada[\[1\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=b,Hawkins\)%2520Birch).  
\- **\~1880s–1890s:** Birch family moves to U.S. (North Dakota), then to Washington/territories. Robert meets Sarah Cope.  
\- **1894:** Robert (age 25\) marries 16-year-old Sarah F. Cope[\[5\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States%2520in%25201930).  
\- **Late 1890s:** Daughter Mary Birch is born (likely in ND or WA).  
\- **1902:** Robert (and brother William) arrive in **Prescott, AZ**. Robert opens a store or works as a merchant.  
\- **1906:** Joseph and Frances Birch (Robert’s parents) relocate to Prescott with younger siblings[\[3\]](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/139874157/joseph-birch%23:~:text=Joseph%2520Birch%2520\(1836,to%2520Prescott,%2520Arizona%2520about%25201906).  
\- **1910s:** Robert acquires or begins managing **Agua Caliente Hot Springs** resort in Maricopa County.  
\- **1920s:** Birch splits time between Prescott and Agua Caliente. Mary Birch comes of age.  
\- **1927:** **Howard Higgins** is born in Tucson to Doris (Kuthe) Higgins[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States).  
\- **1928:** The Birches take in baby Howard. (By end of 1920s, Howard is living at Agua Caliente with Robert and Sarah.)  
\- **1930:** Mary Birch marries Harold Carpenter at Agua Caliente[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her).  
\- **1931:** Gov. Hunt visits Agua Caliente; photographed with Robert Birch[\[13\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/225870%23:~:text=Project%2520azmemory,and%2520Archives%2520Division,%2520Arizona).  
\- **1930s:** Robert continues operating the resort through the Depression; the resort later declines (eventually closing during WWII). Mary Carpenter likely moves to Phoenix area with her husband. Doris Kuthe Higgins leaves Arizona (we find her later as Doris Bynon in Indiana).  
\- **1940s:** Robert in semi-retirement. Howard Birch serves in the military or works (by 1949 he’s marrying in Phoenix). Sarah and Robert move in with Mary’s family in Phoenix as health declines.  
\- **1950:** **Robert W. Birch dies** August 6 in Phoenix at 81[\[14\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=b,Birch%2520Occ:%2520Retired%2520merchant). He is buried back in Prescott beside family.  
\- **1952:** Brother William T. Birch dies in Prescott (last of that generation)[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum).  
\- **1959:** Sarah F. Birch dies in Prescott at 81[\[16\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Sarah%2520F,Allen\)%2520Cope), closing the chapter on the pioneer couple.  
\- **1960s–1990s:** Doris Kuthe (Higgins/Bynon) returns to Arizona, living in Yuma and Tucson, and dies in 1996 at 94\.  
\- **2019:** Howard R. Birch (born Higgins) dies at 92, having proudly carried the Birch name and legacy[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States).

This detailed chronicle showcases Robert W. Birch’s journey from Canadian birth to Arizona pioneer, his entrepreneurial spirit in running a desert hot springs resort, his family’s integration into Arizona society, and his compassionate role in raising young Howard. **Robert W. Birch’s legacy** is reflected in Arizona’s historical records: he was a man who bridged the 19th and 20th centuries, connecting pioneer-era Arizona with the modern era through both blood (his descendants via Mary) and heart (his foster-son Howard). The Birches’ story – even touching the life of an unrelated child – illustrates the tight-knit nature of early Arizona communities, where pioneer families often stepped in to support one another.

**Sources:** Historical details and genealogical data have been drawn from a variety of records and archives, including cemetery and death records[\[33\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=52511%23:~:text=b,Birch%2520Occ:%2520Retired%2520merchant)[\[15\]](https://arizonagravestones.org/view.php?id=28265%23:~:text=Sarah%2520F,Allen\)%2520Cope), museum archives[\[4\]](https://la.sharlothallmuseum.org/index.php/catalogsearch/result/index/?dir=desc&mode=list&order=first_name&p=9&q=november+16%23:~:text=Death%2520certificate:%2520COD:%2520cerebral%2520sclerosis,View%2520Mausoleum), genealogical databases[\[5\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LTM6-XPC/robert-w.-birch-1869-1950%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States%2520in%25201930)[\[22\]](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GB5X-QF2/doris-kuthe-1902-1996%23:~:text=Search%2520ancestors,United%2520States), and newspaper/memory project collections[\[13\]](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/225870%23:~:text=Project%2520azmemory,and%2520Archives%2520Division,%2520Arizona)[\[17\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsfromHyder/posts/6412890675491049/%23:~:text=,lived%2520there%2520with%2520her). These confirm key dates and relationships, such as Robert’s birth/death, marriage to Sarah Cope, operation of Agua Caliente Hot Springs[\[11\]](https://www.arizonahighways.com/archive/issues/chapter/Doc.161.Chapter.14%23:~:text=AJO,%2520Pima%2520Co,Stone), the Hunt connection, and the adoption of Howard (e.g. Howard’s dual surname usage in records[\[23\]](https://www.geni.com/people/Howard-Higgins/6000000222791460744%23:~:text=Howard%2520Robert%2520Higgins%2520\(1927%2520,Howard)). The convergence of these sources paints a comprehensive picture of Robert W. Birch and his extended family in Arizona history.
