# Mowrey first pass not deep

Yes—enough to report concrete anchors, plus what's still missing to answer the parentage/origin questions confidently.

## What's solid so far

### 1) A real "Maurer" immigration candidate in Pennsylvania (1751)

In Pennsylvania Archives (2nd series), the published "Names of Foreigners" lists "Peter Maurer" on the ship Edinburgh, "Qualified Sept. 16, 1751."

This is not proof that your Peter (c. 1760–1840) was foreign-born—but it does strongly support a plausible scenario where:

* an adult Peter Maurer immigrated in 1751, and
* your Peter (born ~1760) could be a son born in Pennsylvania to that immigrant (timing works, but it must be proven with church/tax/land records).

### 2) Where Peter's 1840 Knox County probate should be (and how to pull it)

FamilySearch's catalog shows Knox County, Tennessee "Estate books, 1792–1863" and—critically—identifies Estate book vols. 7–8 (1840–1844) as a specific microfilm/digital group. That's the exact volume range where a will proved in 1840 would normally appear.

Catalog details to target:

* Estate book, v. 7–8 (1840–1844) — Film 464121, DGS 4776046

FamilySearch's Knox County research wiki page also points researchers to the Probate Court Books collection for the county.

## What I have not yet confirmed (so I'm not going to "lock in" conclusions)

* The exact text of the will (wording, witnesses, executor(s), any married daughters named indirectly, etc.).
* Whether there is a separate estate packet (inventories, sale bills, receipts, guardian bonds). Those sometimes exist beyond what's copied into the estate books.
* Any primary Pennsylvania church record tying your Peter (born ~1760) to a specific Maurer household, and tying that household to the 1751 immigrant.

## Immediate next steps (high-yield, minimal wandering)

1. Extract the will entry from Knox Estate Book v.7–8 (1840–1844)

2. Goal: verbatim names, relationships, place hints, witnesses (often relatives), and executor/bondsmen (often sons/sons-in-law).

3. Target volume is identified in the FamilySearch catalog.
4. Search adjacent Knox probate records for the "packet trail"

5. In the same FamilySearch Tennessee probate umbrella, also target things like administrators/executors/guardians records for Knox County (often where bonds and settlements live), not just the estate book copy.
6. Build the Pennsylvania proof chain around the 1751 immigrant candidate

7. Use the 1751 "Peter Maurer" immigrant record as a hypothesis anchor, then look for:

   * PA land/tax where a Peter Maurer appears post-1751,
   * church baptisms for children ~1752–1770,
   * and any record that later shows migration south (VA/TN).

If you want, paste any identifiers you already have for the Knox will (book/page/date or a transcription snippet). With that, I can usually narrow the estate-book browsing target to the exact image range much faster.
