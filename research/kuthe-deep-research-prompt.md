# Deep Research: Frederick Kuthe & German Origins (Web Sources Only)

I'm researching the Kuthe family of Dent County, Missouri. I need everything you can find using web-accessible sources — no phone calls, no archive visits, no paid subscriptions I'd need to access myself. Use FamilySearch, Ancestry previews, Internet Archive, Google Books, Find a Grave, newspaper archives, Geni, WikiTree, and any other free/searchable databases.

## What I know

- **George Washington Kuthe** (1869–1925): born Salem, Dent County, MO. Moved to Oregon early 1890s, then Phoenix, AZ after 1907.
- **Frederick Kuthe**: George's father. German immigrant, reportedly from **Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany** (confirmed anecdotally by another researcher, but no primary source found yet).
- **Sarah Ann Steagall**: George's mother (likely). There's a conflict — a Dent County marriage index shows a "Sarah Ann Kuthe" marrying a Patterson in Nov 1867. Need to resolve.
- George had **brothers** — I've seen references but don't have names/details.

## Priority 1: Frederick Kuthe — find him in US records

Search for Frederick / Fritz / Fred Kuthe (and variants: Kuethe, Küthe, Cooty, Coothe, Kuthy) in:

### Census records (free on FamilySearch)
- **1860 US Census, Dent County, MO** — Frederick should be there with a young household
- **1870 US Census, Dent County, MO** — George (born 1869) should appear as infant
- **1880 US Census, Dent County, MO** — George at age ~11, siblings should be listed
- **Any pre-1860 census** showing Frederick elsewhere (did he come through another state?)

### Immigration / naturalization
- **Castle Garden / Ellis Island** passenger records (online searchable)
- **FamilySearch immigration databases** for Kuthe/Kuethe arrivals
- **Missouri naturalization records** (some are on FamilySearch)
- When did Frederick likely arrive? (If George born 1869 and Frederick was ~25-35 at George's birth, Frederick was born ~1834-1844)

### Darmstadt, Hesse connection
- Are there any **church records** from Darmstadt online (FamilySearch has some German church books)?
- Any other Kuthe/Kuethe families in Missouri with Hesse origins?
- Is there a cluster of Darmstadt immigrants in Dent County?

### Death / burial
- **Find a Grave** search for Frederick Kuthe in Missouri
- Any cemetery records in Dent County
- Missouri death records (if he died after 1910, state records exist)

## Priority 2: George's brothers / siblings

- From the 1880 census, who else is in Frederick's household?
- Any **other Kuthe** entries in Dent County records (1860-1900)?
- Find a Grave, FamilySearch, or Geni profiles for George's siblings
- Did any brothers also go to Oregon or Arizona?
- Are there Kuthe descendants still in Missouri?

## Priority 3: Sarah Ann Steagall

- **Marriage record**: Frederick Kuthe + Sarah Ann Steagall — Dent County? When?
- **The 1867 conflict**: Sarah Ann Kuthe marrying Patterson — is this the same woman? Was Frederick dead by then, or did they divorce?
- **Steagall family** in Dent County — any other records?
- If Sarah remarried Patterson in 1867, was Frederick dead before 1867? (George was born 1869 — does this work out?)

Wait — if Sarah married Patterson in 1867 and George was born 1869, the timeline is suspicious. Either:
- Sarah is NOT George's mother (Frederick had a different wife by 1869)
- The Patterson marriage is a different Sarah Ann Kuthe
- The 1867 date or the 1869 birth is wrong

This needs resolving. Check the 1870 census carefully — who is George living with?

## Priority 4: German origins deep dive

- Search **FamilySearch German church records** for Kuthe/Küthe in Hesse (Darmstadt area)
- Any Kuthe entries in **German emigration databases** (e.g., Hessische Auswanderer-Datenbank)?
- Were there **known waves of Hessian emigration** to Missouri in the 1850s-1860s?
- **Dent County history books** on Google Books or Internet Archive — any mention of German settlers?
- The surname Kuthe/Küthe as "topographic name from Kute/Kaute (quarry/pit)" — does this help locate a specific village?

## Priority 5: Dent County, MO context

- What was the German immigrant community like in Dent County in the 1860s-1870s?
- **Salem, MO** — any local histories online?
- Were there German churches (Lutheran, Catholic) in the area where records might exist?
- Any **Dent County history publications** on Internet Archive or Google Books?

## Constraints

- **Web-only research** — no phone calls, no in-person archive visits
- Free sources preferred; Ancestry/newspapers.com previews are fine for confirming existence of records
- I can access FamilySearch (free account)
- I'm particularly interested in anything that confirms or refutes the Darmstadt origin
- Give me direct links to records where possible
