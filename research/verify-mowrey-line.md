# Research Verification Request: Mowrey/Mowery Line

I'm building a genealogy project and need help verifying the following claims from my family tree. Please check against available census records, Find a Grave, county histories, or other genealogical sources.

## People to verify

### Lewis R. Mowery (1801–1859)
- German immigrant who settled in Tennessee (Knox and Bradley counties)
- Married Elizabeth "Betsy" (maiden name unclear — "Lusby" or "Lisbee"?)
- Father of at least 10 children, including Moses and Pleasant
- Both Lewis and Elizabeth reportedly died in 1859 — can you confirm? Same year seems notable.

### Elizabeth (Lusby? Lisbee?) Mowery (1806–1859)
- Tennessee native (per one source) OR wife of German immigrant Lewis
- Maiden name appears as both "Lusby" and "Lisbee" in different sources — which is correct, or are these variant spellings of the same name?
- Died 1859 — same year as husband Lewis?

### Moses Mansfield Mowery (1822–1904)
- Son of Lewis R. Mowery and Elizabeth
- Married **Margaret E. Witt** (1828–1904) — can you confirm this wife's name and dates?
- Both Moses and Margaret reportedly died in 1904 — confirm?
- Lived in Texas (documented in *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas*)
- Father of Samuel S. Mowrey

### Samuel S. Mowrey (1867–1904)
- Son of Moses Mansfield Mowery and Margaret E. Witt
- Married Effie May Coker (1878–1958)
- Died 1904 — the SAME year as both his parents Moses and Margaret. Three family deaths in one year. Can you confirm this and find cause/circumstances?
- Father of Raymond R. Mowrey (1899–1973)

## Specific questions

1. **The 1859 double death** — Lewis and Elizabeth both dying in 1859. Epidemic? Accident? Or is one of these dates wrong?
2. **The 1904 triple death** — Moses, Margaret, AND Samuel all dying in 1904. What happened? Were they in the same location?
3. **Lisbee vs. Lusby** — What's the correct maiden name for Elizabeth? Any census records showing the original spelling?
4. **Margaret E. Witt** — Where/when did she marry Moses? Any records of her family?
5. **Samuel's middle name** — What does the "S" stand for?
6. **Mowery vs. Mowrey** — The spelling varies across generations. Any pattern to when/why it changed?
