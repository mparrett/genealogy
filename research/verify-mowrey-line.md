# Research Verification Request: Mowrey/Mowery Line

I'm building a genealogy project and need help verifying the following claims from my family tree. Please check against available census records, Find a Grave, county histories, or other genealogical sources.

## People to verify

### Lewis R. Mowery (c. 1801–c. 1850)
- Likely US-born in Knox County, Tennessee (older trees list him as a German immigrant — need confirmation)
- Married Elizabeth "Betsy" (maiden name unclear — "Lisbee" vs "Lusby")
- Father of at least 10 children, including Moses and Pleasant
- Death year disputed in older trees (1850 vs 1859); confirm with records

### Elizabeth (Lisbee/Lusby) Mowery (c. 1806–1859)
- Tennessee native; maiden name appears as both "Lisbee" and "Lusby"
- Died 1859 (likely in Lamar County, TX) — confirm location and burial

### Moses Mansfield Mowery (1822–1904)
- Son of Lewis R. Mowery and Elizabeth
- Married **Margaret E. Witt** (c. 1828–c. 1900/03) — confirm name and dates
- Moses died 29 Aug 1904 in Lamar County, TX — confirm death register entry
- Lived in Texas (documented in *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas*)
- Father of Samuel S. Mowrey

### Samuel S. Mowrey (1867–1904)
- Son of Moses Mansfield Mowery and Margaret E. Witt
- Married Effie May Coker (1878–1958)
- Died 1904 (possibly same day as Moses: 29 Aug 1904) — confirm and find cause/circumstances
- Father of Raymond R. Mowrey (1899–1973)

## Specific questions

1. **Lewis's death year** — c. 1850 vs 1859. Which is correct, and where did he die?
2. **Elizabeth's death location** — confirm Lamar County, TX and burial.
3. **The 1904 same‑day deaths** — Moses and Samuel on 29 Aug 1904? If so, why?
4. **Lisbee vs. Lusby** — what's the correct maiden name for Elizabeth? Any primary records showing the spelling?
5. **Margaret E. Witt** — when/where did she die and marry Moses? Any records of her family?
6. **Samuel's middle name** — what does the \"S\" stand for?
7. **Mowery vs. Mowrey** — spelling variants across records; any pattern to the change?
