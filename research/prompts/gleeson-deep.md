# Deep Research: Gleeson/Fitzgerald Line (Web Sources Only)

I'm researching the Gleeson and Fitzgerald families who settled in Wisconsin. I need help filling in gaps and resolving some confusing overlaps. Web-accessible sources only — FamilySearch, Ancestry previews, newspapers, Find a Grave, WikiTree, Geni, etc.

## What I know (working summary — verify where noted)

- **James J. Gleeson** (Dec 1863 – 28 Jan 1946): Baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick (FamilySearch index lists Jacobus Gleeson; parents Patritii Gleeson + Margaritæ Moloney; image unavailable). Obituary rounded birth year to 1864. Immigrated c. 1883 (arrived New York from Liverpool/Queenstown). Married Maria Ann Fitzgerald 23 Nov 1892 in Mondovi, Buffalo County, WI. Died Waite Park, Stearns County, Minnesota.
- **Maria Ann Fitzgerald** (3 Jul 1865 – 1916): Born Ironton, Sauk County, Wisconsin. Parentage is conflicting in trees and needs verification (James + Margaret Murtagh/Murlagh vs William/James + Mary Ann Feeney). Married James 1892. Died 1916 in Mondovi, WI (confirm).
- **Anne B. Gleeson** (17 Aug 1903 – Jan 1986): Born Mondovi, WI. Married Raymond Mowrey (marriage date reported as 1 Jun 1921 in AZ records; some sources show ~1930). Died Tucson.

## Priority 1: Maria's parents (conflicting parentage)

Search for Maria Fitzgerald as a child in:
- **1870 US Census, Sauk County, Wisconsin** — Maria would be ~5. Look for Fitzgerald household in/near Ironton.
- **1880 US Census, Sauk County, Wisconsin** — Maria would be ~15.

I need:
- Parents' names (resolve conflicting parentage)
- Parents' birthplaces (Ireland — which county?)
- Any siblings
- Father's occupation

This is the key to unlocking the Fitzgerald Irish ancestry.

## Priority 2: Maria's death (1916)

- **Wisconsin death records** (if she died there)
- **Minnesota death records** (if she followed James there)
- **Find a Grave** search for Maria Gleeson / Maria Fitzgerald in WI or MN

Death certificates often include:
- Parents' names (backup source for Priority 1)
- Cause of death
- Informant (often a family member)

## Priority 3: James's naturalization records

Search for James Gleeson naturalization in:
- **Wisconsin** (Buffalo County, where they lived)
- **Minnesota** (Stearns County, where he died)

Naturalization records sometimes include:
- Specific birthplace in Ireland (county, parish, townland)
- Date and port of arrival
- Witnesses (often relatives or fellow immigrants)

## Priority 4: James & Maria's children

Census records show they had multiple children. Please compile a list from 1900, 1910, 1920 census records:
- Names, birth years, birth places
- Which ones survived to adulthood
- Any marriages or death records for the children

From my existing notes I see references to: James Jr., Jennie, John, Joseph, Margaret, Annie (Anne). Need to confirm and organize.

## Priority 5: Gleeson siblings in Croom (Margaret/Margarita, Jane/Janeta)

I may have identified siblings of James J. Gleeson in Croom, County Limerick. Please verify and reconcile these records, and check whether they share the same parents (Patrick Gleeson + Margaret Moloney) as James:

- **Margaret Gleeson** — birth 27 Sep 1875, Croom, Limerick; christening/baptism indexed in FamilySearch.
  - FamilySearch index: `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F5JR-SHL?lang=en`
  - Related index entries: Patrick Gleeson `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F5JR-SHG?lang=en`, Margaret Moloney `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F5JR-SHP?lang=en`
- **Margarita Gleeson** — baptism 29 Sep 1875, Croom, County Limerick (likely same person as Margaret).
  - FamilySearch index: `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:61SW-YRHH?lang=en`
  - Parents indexed: Patritii Gleeson `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:61SW-YRHC?lang=en`, Margaritae Moloney `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:61SW-YRHZ?lang=en`
- **Janeta / Jane Gleeson** — baptism 28 Sep 1878; birth registration 25 Sep 1878; Croom, Limerick.
  - Baptism index: `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XM7H-2H3T?lang=en` (parents Patritii Gleeson + Margarita Moloney)
  - Birth registration index: `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QPRH-573W?lang=en` (parents Patrick Gleeson + Margaret Moloney)

Tasks:
1. Determine whether Margaret/Margarita is the same child and whether the baptism/birth registrations are consistent (dates, townland, parents).
2. Confirm Jane/Janeta as a sibling; reconcile baptism vs civil birth registration.
3. Identify the townland(s) (e.g., Skagh, Croom) and whether these match James’s baptism in Croom.
4. Look for later records (marriage, emigration, death) for Margaret/Margarita and Jane/Janeta to see if either left Ireland or appears in U.S./Australia records.
5. Evaluate whether Margaret/Margaritte who died in Australia (if referenced elsewhere) could be this sibling, or a different person.

## Additional Notes to Verify (from "James Gleeson Notes")

Please verify and reconcile these notes with primary records (census images, passenger lists, etc.), and correct any transcription/name drift (Gleeson/Gleason, Mary/Maria, Annie/Anne, Sabina/Vina/Bina):

- **1900 Census** (Mondovi/Buffalo Co., WI likely): James Gleason 36; Mary Gleason 34; James J 5; Jennie 3; John 1; Joseph P 5/12; Bertha Ness 16.
- **1910 Census**: James 44; Mary 44; James 15; Jennie 12; John 11; Joseph 10; Margaret 8; Annie 6.
- **1920 Census**: James 54; Janie 22; John 21; Anna 16.
- **1930 Census**: James 64; Vina 45; John 31; Bridget Laughney 78; Henry Weiss 21. (Check if “Vina” is Sabina/Bina O’Brien; Bridget Laughney may be a relative or boarder.)
- **1940 Census**: Raymond Thiesen 37; Margaret Thiesen 38; children Donna Jean, Joan C, Marjorie A, Jacqueline; James J Reduson 74 (verify name/relationship—possible misread of Gleeson?).

Other leads to verify:
- **Immigration**: Passenger list entry for James Gleeson, age 19 (born 1864 per manifest), arrived New York 29 Sep 1883 from Liverpool/Queenstown; destination Chicago, Illinois. (Ancestry collection 7488, record id 11836836). Reconcile birth year with 1863 baptism.
- **Minnesota lead**: “James Gleeson (or Gleason), age 24, Ireland, no parents listed, Minneapolis, MN, 16 Jun 1885” — determine exact record type (city directory? naturalization?).
- **Parish register image**: Ancestry image for Croom parish register showing baptism 23 Dec 1863 (NLI microfilm 02427/07; Ancestry collection 61039, image 02427_07_0087, pId 2987443).
- **Other Ancestry lead**: “James Joseph?” record (collection 1629, record id 8314422) — determine if it matches our James (Mondovi marriage context?).
- **Possible legal/newspaper item**: “Patrick stole a cow” (unverified). If this refers to Patrick Gleeson (James’s father) or a different Patrick, confirm via newspaper or court record and keep separate if unrelated.

If any of these are incorrect or belong to a different James Gleeson, flag them and explain why.

## Priority 6: Patrick Gleeson disambiguation (IMPORTANT)

**The problem:** James's father is listed as Patrick Gleeson. There is confusion about whether a related Gleeson/Moloney line went to Australia or England (some trees show a Margaritte Malony dying in Drouin, Victoria, Australia in 1886). We need to confirm whether that is related or a different family.

**What I need:**
- Any records for Patrick Gleeson (father of James J. Gleeson, husband of Margaret Moloney) that clarify his immigration path
- Are there multiple Patrick Gleesons in the MN/WI area in the 1880s-1900s with Irish origins?
- Any Australian or English passenger records for a Patrick Gleeson that might be getting confused with our Patrick?
- Death record for Patrick Gleeson in MN/WI that might confirm birthplace

**Disambiguation clues:**
- Our Patrick should be connected to Margaret Moloney (wife) and James J. Gleeson (son baptized 23 Dec 1863, Croom, Limerick)
- If Patrick came via Australia/England, there might be a different arrival date or port
- Check for multiple Patrick Gleeson + Margaret combinations

## Priority 7: Irish origins — townland & civil birth confirmation

If any records give a more specific Irish origin than just "Ireland," note them:
- County (Tipperary is common for Gleeson surname)
- Parish or townland
- Any references to specific places in naturalization, obituaries, or church records

## Constraints

- **Web-only research** — no phone calls, no in-person archive visits
- Free sources preferred; Ancestry previews fine for confirming record existence
- I can access FamilySearch (free account)
- Focus on disambiguation — help me untangle overlapping Patrick Gleeson records

## Format

For each priority, give me:
1. What you found (with source)
2. Confidence level (confirmed vs. probable vs. uncertain)
3. Any conflicts or ambiguities that need resolving
4. Recommended next steps

Be explicit about when records might be referring to different people with similar names.
