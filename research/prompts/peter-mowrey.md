## Context for the Researcher

This research connects to a larger family history project documenting four family lines converging in Arizona. The Mowrey line traces from Tennessee to Texas (1850s) and eventually to Williams, Arizona (1920s-30s). Establishing Peter's origins would confirm whether the "German immigrant" family tradition refers to Peter himself or his parents/grandparents.

The 1840 Knox County will is the key anchor document. Finding the original probate packet might reveal more about the family (inventory, heirs, witnesses).

## Deliverables Requested

1. **Summary of findings** on Peter's origins and the Maurer immigration
2. **Source citations** for any records found
3. **Timeline** of Peter's life with locations
4. **Family group sheet** showing parents, spouse, and children
5. **Recommendations** for further research (archives, DNA, etc.)
