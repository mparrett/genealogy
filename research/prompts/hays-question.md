help me understand this Hays person and lineage, maybe connectoin (if any) to Rutherfurd B. I have a small snippet from one of my relatives (A Peter Maurer in the rev war): "Augusta County Militia in Virginia. He served in Captain Hays' ..." is this the same hays? https://www.revwarapps.org/s37973.pdf
here's another link https://allthingsliberty.com/2023/01/the-eastern-shore-battalion-the-story-of-the-9th-virginia-regiment/

### What “Hays” is in the PDF you linked (S37973)

Your PDF is the pension file **S37973 for William Hays**—he is the *veteran/applicant*, not “Captain Hays.” ([Revolutionary War Applications][1])

Key identifiers inside that file:

* He says he was **born in Augusta County, Virginia (10 Mar 1761)**, and that as a boy his father moved the family to **Rutherford County, North Carolina**. ([Revolutionary War Applications][1])
* In the described Revolutionary service he volunteered in a **company of Capt. Adam Hampton** (with McDowell). ([Revolutionary War Applications][1])

So if your relative’s snippet is “Augusta County Militia in Virginia. He served in Captain Hays’ …”, that wording does **not** match what’s happening in S37973 (where Hays is the soldier, and Hampton is one of the captains named). ([Revolutionary War Applications][1])

### The “Captain Hays” connected to Peter Maurer / Mowry

There is a separate pension file on revwarapps for **Peter Mowry** (spelled variants of *Mowry/Mowrey/Maurer* show up a lot in these records) where the declaration includes language like:

* he was **“enrolled at Captain Hays’ in Augusta County, Virginia”**, and then served in a company under **Capt. Thomas Smith** attached to a regiment under **Col. Campbell**, including the march that culminates around **Guilford Court House**. ([Revolutionary War Applications][2])

That description aligns very closely with the snippet you quoted, and it’s the strongest match I’ve seen in the material we pulled up.

### Is “Captain Hays” in the Peter Maurer/Mowry context the *same* as “Hays” in S37973?

**Almost certainly not.**

* In **S37973**, “Hays” is the *pensioner* (William Hays), and the service details point to NC/KY frontier contexts and different named officers (e.g., Capt. Adam Hampton). ([Revolutionary War Applications][1])
* In the **Peter Mowry/Maurer-style wording**, “Captain Hays’” reads like a **local enrollment / rendezvous point** in Augusta County militia administration (often literally “at Capt. ___’s place”), while the field chain of command can be someone else (e.g., Capt. Thomas Smith). ([Revolutionary War Applications][2])

### What “Captain Hays” likely means (and why it’s hard to pin down)

In Virginia militia practice, it’s common for a pensioner to describe:

* where they were **enrolled / rendezvoused** (often at a local captain’s home or muster location), and
* who they **actually marched under** once formed into a detachment.

That’s consistent with “enrolled at Captain Hays’ …” but then serving under Capt. Thomas Smith. ([Revolutionary War Applications][2])

**Practical implication:** “Captain Hays” might be a *local militia captain* in Augusta County whose job was to gather men—yet not the same officer the applicant marched under, and not necessarily a person who left abundant surviving documentation under that exact phrasing.

### Where the 9th Virginia Regiment link might fit (and where it probably doesn’t)

The 9th Virginia Regiment is **Continental Line**, not county militia. Some pension narratives do name a **Capt. John Hays** associated with the **9th Virginia Regiment**. ([Revolutionary War Applications][3])

That proves there *was* a Capt. Hays in Virginia service, but it **doesn’t automatically connect** to the Augusta County militia “Captain Hays’” muster-point phrasing in the Peter Mowry/Maurer context. In other words: plausible name collision, not a confirmed identity.

### Any connection to Rutherford B. Hayes?

Based on what’s in these pension materials, **there is no indicated connection**—they don’t mention him, his family, or any linkable associates. The only overlap is surname similarity (and note the presidential surname is typically “Hayes,” not “Hays”).

If you want to seriously test a connection, the shortest path is:

1. Identify the **first name + neighborhood** of the Augusta County “Captain Hays” (or at least narrow to 1–2 candidates).
2. Build that Hays man’s **descendancy or ancestry** one generation at a time using court, land, and probate records.
3. Only then compare to Rutherford B. Hayes’s documented paternal line.

### Actionable next step that usually cracks this

Search **other** pension files for men who:

* were from **Augusta County**, and
* marched under **Capt. Thomas Smith / Col. Campbell** to Guilford,
  and see whether any of them give **Captain Hays a first name** (or give a landmark like a creek, church, or neighborhood). Once one person says “Capt. *John* Hays” (or similar) in the same context, you can triangulate.

If you want, paste the exact paragraph from the Peter Mowry/Maurer pension (the one containing “Captain Hays’”), and I’ll extract every identifying clue in it (place names, dates, officer stack, route) and use that to narrow which Hays it most likely was.
