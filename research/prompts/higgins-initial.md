# Higgins/Knight Line Research — First Pass (Web Search)

I'm researching the Higgins and Knight families. This line connects to the Kuthe family through marriage (James E. Higgins married Doris Kuthe in 1926). I need help filling in their story. Web-accessible sources only.

## What I know (working summary)

### Laurence Higgins (1854–before 17 Feb 1930)
- 2nd great-grandfather
- Birth: 8 Jan 1854, Rathmines, Dublin, Ireland (needs confirmation)
- Death: before 17 Feb 1930 (Mary admitted to almshouse as widowed); exact date/place unknown
- Married Mary Knight
- Father of James Everett Higgins

### Mary Knight (1866–1930)
- 2nd great-grandmother
- Birth: Aug 1866, Co. Sligo, Ireland (needs confirmation)
- Death: 27 Mar 1930, New York (died in almshouse, admitted 17 Feb 1930 as widowed)

## What I need to find

### Laurence Higgins
- Confirm birth and parents (Irish records)
- Immigration timing/port
- Census trail (1880–1920)
- Exact death date/place (pre‑1930) and burial
- Any naturalization records?

### Mary Knight
- Confirm birthplace in Ireland — what county/parish?
- When did she immigrate?
- Verify Dublin (1883) and Manhattan (1887) marriage records
- Why was she in a New York almshouse in 1930 (widowed)?

### James Knight & Bridget Larney (Mary's parents)
- Any records for these parents?
- Immigration records?
- Other children (Mary's siblings)?

### James E. Higgins
- Confirm birthplace and early census records
- How did he end up in Arizona by 1926?
- Death record (1938) — confirm date/place/cause
- Confirm middle name "Everett" via primary source

### Howard R. Higgins Birch connection
- Confirm foster/adoption details with the Birch family
- When/where did the Birch surname attach to Howard?

## General questions
- Where did this family live? (New York? Elsewhere before Arizona?)
- Irish origins — what county for Higgins and Knight?
- How did James E. end up in Phoenix where he married Doris Kuthe?

## Format

For each person:
1. What you found (with source)
2. What it tells us about the Ireland → US → Arizona path
3. Any leads worth pursuing

Keep it concise — first pass to see what's out there.
