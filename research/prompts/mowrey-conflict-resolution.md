# Deep Research Task: Resolve Mowery/Mowrey Genealogical Conflicts

I need you to search public genealogical databases, newspaper archives, and historical records to help resolve specific conflicts in my Mowery/Mowrey family tree. Focus on finding primary source evidence.

## Priority 1: The August 29, 1904 Double Death Mystery

**Claim:** Moses Mansfield Mowery (age 81) and his son Samuel S. Mowrey (age 37) both died on August 29, 1904 in Lamar County, Texas.

**Research needed:**
- Search Texas death records/indexes for Lamar County, August 1904
- Search Paris, TX and Lamar County newspapers (Paris Morning News, etc.) for late August/early September 1904 obituaries or death notices
- Look for any reports of accidents, epidemics, or shared events in Milton/Lamar County around that date
- Check if this is date-copying error or a real documented event

## Priority 2: Samuel S. Mowrey's 1904 New Jersey / "Soldier" Record

**Conflict:** Samuel appears in New Jersey on April 5, 1904, with "Relation to Head: Soldier" — but he supposedly died in Texas on August 29, 1904.

**Research needed:**
- Search U.S. military records for "Samuel Mowrey" or "Samuel Mowery" around 1900-1904
- Check if there was another Samuel S. Mowrey/Mowery who served in the military (possible record merge)
- Look for any military installations in New Jersey that might have Texas connections in 1904
- Determine: Is this our Samuel, or a different person merged into the tree?

## Priority 3: Moses's Wife Margaret — Death Year Conflict

**Conflict:** Margaret Elizabeth Witt Mowery is listed with death year 1904, but Moses appears as "widowed" in the 1900 census.

**Research needed:**
- Find the actual 1900 census record for Moses Mowery in Lamar County — verify his marital status
- Search Texas death records for Margaret Witt Mowery/Mowrey, 1898-1904
- Look for cemetery records in Milton Cemetery, Lamar County
- Determine: Did Margaret die before 1900, or is the 1900 census record incorrect?

## Priority 4: Lewis R. Mowery and Elizabeth Lisbee — Same Death Date, Different States

**Conflict:** Both Lewis and Elizabeth supposedly died on August 20, 1859 — Lewis in Hempstead County, Arkansas; Elizabeth in Lamar County, Texas.

**Research needed:**
- This looks like a data entry error. Search for actual death records or probate for:
  - Lewis R. Mowery, c. 1850 (Tennessee or en route west)
  - Elizabeth Lisbee Mowery, 1859 (Texas)
- Check Arkansas records for any Mowery presence
- The 1889 *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* states Lewis "died in 1850" — find the actual page/quote if possible

## Priority 5: Cecilia Mae — Samuel's Daughter or Stepchild?

**Claim:** Cecilia Mae Hambrock Coker Bond (born March 3, 1895) is listed as Samuel's daughter, but Samuel married Effie May Coker in June 1897.

**Research needed:**
- Was Cecilia Effie's child from a prior relationship?
- Search for Effie May Coker's earlier marriage records
- The compound surname suggests multiple marriages — trace Cecilia's actual parentage

## Sources to prioritize:
- FamilySearch.org free records
- FindAGrave.com for burial locations
- Newspapers.com or similar for Texas newspaper archives
- Texas State Library death indexes
- *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* (1889), page 622

Please return findings organized by priority, with links to sources where possible.
