# Deep Research: Higgins/Knight Line — Unresolved Questions

Building on initial research. Need help resolving specific confusions and going deeper on Irish origins. Web sources only.

## Priority 1: The Mary Knight / Laurence Higgins Timeline Problem

**The confusion:**
- Mary Knight (née) Higgins died **27 Mar 1930** in a New York almshouse
- She was listed as **"widowed"** at admission (17 Feb 1930)
- Some sources list Laurence Higgins as dying in **1940**, but other evidence suggests he died before Feb 1930

**Possible explanations:**
1. Laurence's death date (1940) is wrong — he died before 1930
2. They were separated/divorced
3. The Mary Higgins in the almshouse is a different person
4. "Widowed" was recorded in error

**What I need:**
- Death record for Laurence Higgins — when and where did he actually die?
- Marriage record for Laurence Higgins + Mary Knight — when/where?
- Census records 1900, 1910, 1920 showing them together (or not)
- Any divorce records?
- Confirm the almshouse Mary Higgins is the same as Mary Knight

## Priority 2: Howard R. Higgins Birch — The Dual Surname

**The confusion:**
- Howard R. Higgins Birch (1927–2019) was son of James E. Higgins + Doris Kuthe
- His children carry surname "Birch" not "Higgins"

**What I need:**
- Confirm foster/adoption by Robert Birch + Sarah Cope Birch (timing, location, legal status)
- When did the Birch surname get attached to Howard?
- Any orphanage records (Silver City, NM) or court adoption records?

**Timeline to check:**
- James E. Higgins dies 1938 (Howard is ~16)
- Doris would have been widowed with a teenage son
- Did she remarry?

## Priority 3: James E. Higgins — Path to Arizona

**Questions:**
- Born 2 Feb 1892 in Manhattan, New York (confirm via primary record)
- Census records 1900, 1910, 1920 — where was he living?
- How/why did he end up in Phoenix, Arizona by 1926?
- Did he follow the Kuthe family there? (George Kuthe moved to Phoenix after 1907)
- What was his occupation?
- Death 6 Jul 1938 — where, cause of death? (confirm)
- Confirm middle name "Everett" via primary record

## Priority 4: Irish Origins

### Higgins family
- Laurence born c. 1854 — Ireland? What county?
- Parents' names?
- Higgins is common in Ireland — any clues to narrow down (Mayo, Sligo, Clare are common)

### Knight family
- Mary's parents: James Knight + Bridget Larney
- Any records for them in Ireland or US?
- What county in Ireland?
- Larney/Larne suggests possible Ulster connection?

## Priority 5: New York Connections

Based on Mary's death in NYC and possible family base there:
- Search for Higgins/Knight in New York census records
- Any other Higgins or Knight family members in NYC area?
- Church records (likely Catholic given Irish background)

## Specific Records to Find

1. **Laurence Higgins death record** — critical to resolve the 1930/1940 conflict
2. **Laurence + Mary marriage record** — where/when married
3. **1900/1910/1920 census** for Higgins household
4. **James E. Higgins death certificate** (1938) — California?
5. **Howard R. Higgins adoption/foster record** — Birch family
6. **Howard R. Higgins birth certificate** — does it show Higgins or Birch?

## Constraints
