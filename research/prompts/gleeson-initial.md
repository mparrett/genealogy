# Gleeson/Fitzgerald Research — First Pass (Web Search)

I'm researching the Gleeson and Fitzgerald families who ended up in Arizona. Their Ireland-to-US story is sparse and I'd like to fill it in. Please search what you can find using free/public web sources.

## What I know (working summary)

- **James J. Gleeson** (Dec 1863–28 Jan 1946): 2nd great-grandfather. Baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick (FamilySearch index lists Jacobus Gleeson; parents Patritii Gleeson + Margaritæ Moloney; image unavailable). Obituary rounded birth year to 1864. Died in Waite Park, Stearns County, Minnesota.
- **Maria Ann Fitzgerald** (3 Jul 1865–1916): 2nd great-grandmother. Born in Ironton, Sauk County, Wisconsin (US-born to Irish immigrant parents). Parentage is conflicting in trees and needs verification.
- **Anne B. Gleeson** (17 Aug 1903–Jan 1986): Their daughter, my great-grandmother. Born Mondovi, Wisconsin; died Tucson, Arizona. Married Raymond R. Mowrey (marriage date reported as 1 Jun 1921 in AZ records, but some sources say ~1930).

The family reached Arizona through Anne, but I still need:
- Where in Ireland the Gleeson line came from (county/parish)
- When James J. immigrated and where he first settled
- Maria's parents and their Irish origins
- When/why Anne moved to Arizona and which marriage date is correct

## What I'd like you to search

### James J. Gleeson (b. 1863, d. 1946)
- US Census records (1870–1940) — where was he living? Birthplace listed?
- Confirm birthplace in Ireland (county/parish if possible)
- Immigration/passenger records (arrival date/port)
- Marriage record to Maria Ann Fitzgerald — where and when?
- Death record / Find a Grave / obituary
- Any naturalization records?

### Maria Ann Fitzgerald (b. 1865, d. 1916)
- Confirm birthplace and parents' names from census/marriage/death records
- Death record (1916 is early enough for state records in most places)
- Find a Grave
- Where did she die? (Likely Wisconsin; confirm)

### Anne B. Gleeson (b. 1903, d. 1986)
- Where was she born? (This tells us where James & Maria were living by 1903)
- Marriage to Raymond Mowrey — confirm date (1921 vs ~1930) and location
- 1910/1920 census with parents

### General
- Are there Gleeson/Fitzgerald clusters in WI/MN that indicate a first landing point?
- Any Arizona records tied specifically to Anne (not James/Maria)?
- Irish emigration patterns — are there known Gleeson/Fitzgerald origins in specific Irish counties?

## Format

For each person, give me:
1. What you found (with source)
2. What it tells us about the Ireland → US → Arizona path
3. Any leads worth pursuing further

Keep it concise — this is a first pass to see what's out there before I do a deeper dive.
