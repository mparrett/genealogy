# Deep Research: Parrett Line (Three Generations)

## Objective

Verify and clarify the records for three generations of the Parrett family in Indiana, resolving known discrepancies and filling gaps with primary source evidence.

## Subjects

1. **Amos Parret** (c. 1820–1863) — Civil War soldier, died Helena, Arkansas
2. **John Anderson Parrett** (1859–1938) — Civil War orphan, Lagro farmer
3. **Adam Amos Parrett** (1885–1959) — Cleveland tradesman, our 2nd great-grandfather

## Priority Questions

### Amos Parret (c. 1820–1863)

**Current knowledge:** Died September 24, 1863 in Helena, Arkansas. Married to Mary Shelly (1825–1907). Father of John Anderson Parrett. Currently described as "likely serving in the Union Army" — this is speculative.

**Questions:**
1. What Indiana regiment did Amos Parret serve in? (Check Indiana volunteer infantry rosters, especially regiments that served at Helena, AR)
2. What was his rank and enlistment date?
3. Was his death combat-related or disease? (Helena was a major Union depot with significant disease mortality)
4. Where and when was Amos born? (c. 1820, location unknown)
5. When and where did Amos marry Mary Shelly?
6. Is there a pension file for his widow Mary Shelly/Mary Irey?

**Suggested sources:**
- Indiana Civil War service records (Fold3, Ancestry)
- U.S. Civil War Soldier Records and Profiles
- Helena, Arkansas military hospital records, 1863
- Indiana widow pension applications
- Wabash County marriage records, 1840s-1850s

### John Anderson Parrett (1859–1938)

**Current knowledge:** Born May 1, 1859, Wabash County. Civil War orphan at age 4. Married Mary Ellen Fisher 1884. Six children. Second marriage to Medora Alice Kuldau 1926. Buried Lagro Township Cemetery.

**Key discrepancy:** The 1920 census (Huntington, Ward 3) lists John as a "widower" working as a cashier — but Mary Ellen Fisher lived until 1953. Were they separated? Divorced? Is this a census error?

**Questions:**
1. What is the explanation for the 1920 "widower" status? Check:
   - Indiana divorce records 1900-1920
   - Mary Ellen Fisher's 1920 census location (was she enumerated elsewhere?)
   - Possible census transcription error
2. Why the dramatic occupation changes? (Farmer 1900 → Laborer 1910 → Cashier 1920 → Plasterer 1930)
3. Did John lose the farm? Check Wabash County land records.
4. The 1926 marriage to Medora Alice Kuldau — was this legal if still married to Mary Ellen?
5. Where exactly was John born? Bio says "Wabash County, likely near South Whitley in Whitley County" — these are different counties.

**Suggested sources:**
- 1920 census: locate Mary Ellen Fisher separately
- Indiana divorce records, Wabash/Huntington County, 1910-1925
- Wabash County deed/land records
- Indiana marriage records for 1926 Kuldau marriage (would require divorce or death)

### Adam Amos Parrett (1885–1959)

**Current knowledge:** Born April 21, 1885, Wabash County. Married three times. Moved to Cleveland, worked as tool and die maker. Two sons drowned 1951. Died Wabash, Indiana 1959.

**Questions:**
1. Why did Adam marry Mary Ann Beeks in St. Joseph, Michigan (August 1906)? Was he working there? Was she from there?
2. What happened to Mary Ann Beeks after the children were born?
   - Did she die? (Check death records 1919-1921)
   - Did they divorce? (Check Indiana/Ohio divorce records)
   - The 1921 marriage to Nettie suggests Mary Ann was gone by then.
3. Were Nettie Thompson O'Connor and Lillie Thompson Graham sisters? (Both "Thompson," married within one month of Nettie's death)
4. What was the Mud Lake drowning incident (May 13, 1951)? Check:
   - Whitley County newspapers, May 1951
   - Columbia City newspapers
   - Death certificates for James Franklin and Ferry Ellsworth Parrett
5. Adam's 1920 census location is listed as "Cleveland, Whitley, Indiana" in sources — this seems wrong (Cleveland is in Ohio, Whitley is in Indiana). Clarify actual 1920 location.

**Suggested sources:**
- Berrien County, Michigan records (1906 marriage context)
- Ohio death records for Nettie Thompson O'Connor (1926)
- Indiana/Ohio divorce records for Adam Amos Parrett
- Whitley County, Indiana newspapers, May 1951
- 1920 census — verify actual enumeration location
