### **Doris Pauline Kuthe (1902–1996)**
**Relationship:** Biological grandmother (mother of Howard Higgins/Birch)

*Resilient Educator, Devoted Mother, Lifelong Friend*

Doris Pauline Kuthe was born on August 16, 1902, in Jefferson, Marion County, Oregon, the second daughter of **George Washington Kuthe** (1869–1925) and **Huldah Imogene Bridgefarmer** (1873–1907). She entered a world of pioneer families making their way in the Pacific Northwest, but her childhood would be marked by loss and resilience from an early age.

On August 6, 1907, when Doris was just four years old, her mother Huldah died. The little girl found herself in a reconstituted family as her father remarried and had more children. Despite this early trauma, Doris would prove herself remarkably resilient, pursuing education and a teaching career in an era when many women had far fewer options.

By 1912, the Kuthe family had relocated to Phoenix, Arizona Territory, joining the migration of families seeking opportunity in the growing Southwest. Doris attended school in Phoenix throughout her teenage years, appearing in school census records from 1913 through 1920. Even at age eighteen and twenty-one, she continued her education—an early sign of the dedication to learning that would define her professional life.

More loss followed. Her father George died on December 2, 1925, when Doris was twenty-three. Just two months later, on February 2, 1926, her sister Frances died at age twenty-seven. These losses would shape the difficult year ahead.

## Agua Caliente

By August 1926, Doris had made her way to **Agua Caliente Hot Springs**, a remote 22-room resort hotel in the Gila River desert operated by **Robert W. Birch** and his wife **Sarah Frances Cope Birch**. Voter registration records from August 20, 1926, show Doris living at Agua Caliente—part of the small community that gathered around the mineral springs and the hospitality of the Birch family.

How she came to be there remains unclear. She may have worked at the resort, been a guest, or found refuge with the Birches through mutual connections. What matters is that she was already **integrated into the Agua Caliente community** when, on November 6, 1926, she married **James Everett Higgins**, a railroad civil engineer working in Arizona.

The marriage was brief. By March 20, 1927—less than four months after the wedding—Doris was three months pregnant and standing with Governor George W. P. Hunt at the King Woolsey ruins near Agua Caliente, photographed alongside Mary Birch and other members of the resort's social circle. James was not in the photograph. He was already in California.

On September 15, 1927, Doris gave birth to **Howard Robert Higgins** in Tucson, Arizona. The birth certificate lists her residence as Tucson, her occupation as "Housewife - Teacher," and James's residence as **San Francisco, California**. The couple was geographically separated before their son was even born. The marriage had lasted less than ten months.

## A Mother's Decision

By late 1928, Doris faced circumstances no young woman should face alone. Her husband was in California. She was twenty-six years old, a single working mother with an infant son, living through an era when a woman's options were severely constrained. In August 1928, her brother Wallace fell critically ill in Tucson; he would die that November at age twenty-seven, another profound loss in a life already marked by grief.

The divorce was filed in December 1928. And sometime around then, Doris made a decision that would shape the rest of Howard's life—and her own.

She did not abandon her son. She placed him with **Robert and Sarah Birch**, the couple at Agua Caliente whom she had known since at least August 1926. The Birches were in their late fifties, established and stable, with their daughter Mary grown. They had the means and the desire to raise a child. Doris had an existing relationship with them—she was part of their community, their social circle, their world.

This was not a crisis handoff to strangers. This was a **thoughtful arrangement within a community of care**.

## Maintained Connection

And Doris did not disappear.

On September 26, 1929, when Howard was two years old, the Arizona Republic noted: "**Doris Higgins visits Agua Caliente - Doris spent Sunday with Burch family.**"

On April 7, 1933, when Howard was five, the Casa Grande Dispatch reported: "**Doris travels to Agua Caliente to visit her small son Howard.**" At the time, Doris was teaching in the Vekol Valley area and would marry her third husband, Henry H. Bynon, six months later.

These visits—and likely others that went unrecorded—prove that Doris maintained a relationship with her son throughout his childhood. The newspapers acknowledged him as "her small son." The Birch family welcomed her visits. This was not a story of abandonment. This was a story of **sustained connection across difficult circumstances**.

## A Teaching Life

While Howard grew up at Agua Caliente with the Birches, Doris built a career. She taught in Buckeye in 1930, in the Vekol Valley area in the early 1930s, and in Nogales by 1940. She obtained her Three Year Diploma from Flagstaff in March 1932, continuing her education even while navigating the Great Depression and personal upheaval.

Her marriages came and went. After divorcing James Higgins in 1930, she married Claude M. Allen in May 1930—a union that ended in divorce within a few years. Her third marriage, to **Henry H. Bynon** on September 20, 1933, lasted fourteen years until Henry's death in Phoenix on November 29, 1947. She signed Howard's amended birth certificate as "Doris K. Bynon," changing his original name from "James Everett Higgins" to "Howard Robert Higgins"—a symbolic severing of the connection to the father who had moved to San Francisco before his birth.

Through it all, Doris kept teaching. By 1950, at age forty-eight, she had risen to **Supervisor of Elementary Schools** in Nogales, Arizona—a position of leadership and respect. She had built a professional life despite losing her mother at four, her father at twenty-three, enduring four marriages (one ending in her husband's death), and raising a son in an arrangement that required extraordinary trust and sacrifice.

## Lifelong Friendship

Doris's connection to the Birch family endured far beyond Howard's childhood. On October 5, 1930, she attended Mary Birch's wedding to Harold Carpenter—welcomed as a guest despite being divorced from James, still part of the family's social circle. And on November 13, 1953—twenty-six years after Howard's birth and three years after Robert Birch's death—Doris signed as a witness to **Sarah Birch's lease** of property in Phoenix.

This moment, captured in legal documents, speaks volumes. Doris, then fifty-one, remained close enough to Sarah Birch—then a widow of about seventy-five—to witness her legal affairs. The friendship that began when Doris lived at Agua Caliente in 1926 had lasted **more than a quarter century**. Doris did not lose touch with the woman who raised her son. She honored that relationship until Sarah's death in 1959.

## Later Years

In 1962, at age fifty-nine, Doris married for the fourth and final time, wedding **John Ashfield McGuire** in Nogales on July 10. They would remain together for twenty-two years until John's death on June 1, 1984. Doris was eighty-one when she became a widow for the second time.

She lived another twelve years, dying on February 22, 1996, in Nogales, Arizona, at the age of ninety-three. She was survived by her son Howard R. Birch—then sixty-eight—and his children and grandchildren, the descendants of the baby boy she had entrusted to the Birches nearly seventy years before.

Doris Pauline Kuthe's life defies simple narratives. She was not a woman who abandoned her child. She was a woman who, faced with impossible circumstances in 1928, made a decision grounded in love, trust, and community. She placed her son with people she knew and trusted—people who had been her friends and neighbors. She visited him. She maintained relationships with the Birches for decades. She built a successful career as an educator and rose to a supervisory position. She married four times, endured loss after loss, and lived with dignity to age ninety-three.

The March 1927 photograph of Doris standing with Governor Hunt at Agua Caliente—three months pregnant, part of the Birches' social world—captures her at a pivotal moment. The documented visits in 1929 and 1933, the witness signature in 1953, all tell the same story: Doris never disappeared. She remained present, connected, and committed to the relationships that mattered most.

Her legacy lives on in the descendants of Howard Robert Birch, who carry forward the story of a woman who navigated hardship with resilience, made difficult choices with courage, and honored her commitments across a lifetime.
