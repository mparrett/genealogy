# Elizabeth "Betsy" Lisbee Mowery
**Relationship:** 4th great-grandmother (Mowery line)

*Tennessee Native, Pioneer Wife, Maternal Matriarch*

**Elizabeth "Betsy" Lisbee** was born in Tennessee, likely around 1806, and became the matriarch of the Mowery family in America through her marriage to **Lewis R. Mowery** on **3 March 1819 in Knox County, Tennessee**[^1]. Her life represents the experiences of countless pioneer women who helped build families and communities on the American frontier.

### Early Life and Family Background

Elizabeth was the daughter of **Moses Lisbee** and **Lucy [?]** of Knox County, Tennessee[^2]. The Lisbee family name is uncommon, and they were likely among the families who moved into Tennessee during its early territorial period. Her nickname "Betsy" was common for Elizabeth during this era and suggests she was known by this familiar name throughout her life.

### Marriage and Family Life

Elizabeth married **Lewis R. Mowery** on **3 March 1819** in Knox County, Tennessee[^3]. Their union represents a common pattern on the expanding American frontier—established Tennessee families merging with newer arrivals.

Together, Elizabeth and Lewis raised a large family of at least ten children[^4], including:

- **Moses Mansfield Mowery** (1822-1904) - Later became a Texas pioneer
- **Pleasant A. Mowrey** - Documented in Texas historical records
- **Ephraim Lusby Mowery** - Carried his mother's family name as middle name
- **Lewis Daily Mowery** - Named after his father
- *[Additional children to be researched and documented]*

### The Lisbee Legacy

The Lisbee family name continued through Elizabeth's descendants, with several of her grandchildren carrying the name as a middle name (often spelled "Lusby" in later records), demonstrating the family's commitment to preserving maternal lineage[^5]. This practice suggests the Lisbee family held significance in the community and that Elizabeth maintained strong connections to her birth family.

### Pioneer Life in Tennessee

Elizabeth lived through the transformation of Tennessee from frontier territory to established state. She would have experienced the challenges of pioneer life: raising a large family in a log cabin, managing household production, and supporting her husband's farming endeavors. The family's move from Knox County to Bradley County around 1837 likely reflected their search for better land and opportunities[^6].

### Widowhood and Move to Texas

Lewis died around 1850, leaving Elizabeth a widow. In the years that followed, her son Moses (who had settled in Red River County, Texas by 1853) likely encouraged the remaining family to join him. Elizabeth eventually made the journey to Texas, where she died in **1859 in Lamar County**[^7]. Her youngest son Pleasant arrived in Texas that same year, reportedly "the year of his mother's death." Elizabeth is believed to be buried in Lamar County, though no grave marker has been found.

### Maternal Influence

Elizabeth's influence on her children extended far beyond Tennessee. Multiple grandchildren carried the Lisbee family name (often rendered as "Lusby" in later records), demonstrating that her heritage was valued by subsequent generations.

### Research Notes

**Spelling confirmed:** The 1819 Knox County marriage record uses "Lisbee" (Elizabeth Lisbee); the 1889 *Biographical Souvenir* uses "Lisby." Both refer to the same family—"Lisbee" appears to be the original spelling, with "Lisby" a phonetic variant. The later spelling "Lusby" in descendants' names (e.g., Ephraim Lusby Mowery) is a further evolution.

*Additional research needed on:*
- *Moses Lisbee (Elizabeth's father) — birth/death, other Knox County records; the Lisbee surname is rare*
- *Complete list of children and their birth years*
- *Exact burial location in Lamar County, TX*
- *Birth year discrepancy: the 1889 Biographical Souvenir gives 1815, which better fits a marriage in 1819; earlier trees showing ~1806 may be erroneous*
