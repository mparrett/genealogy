### **Robert W. Birch (1869–1950)**
**Relationship:** Foster great-great-grandfather (raised Howard Higgins/Birch)

*Canadian Pioneer, Arizona Hotelier, Guardian of the Birch Name*

Robert William Birch was born on May 23, 1869, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the son of **Joseph Birch** (1836–1917) and **Frances Hawkins Birch**. The Birch family left Canada in the late 19th century, settling first in North Dakota where Joseph ran a ranch, before relocating to Arizona Territory around 1906.

On May 23, 1894—his twenty-fifth birthday—Robert married **Sarah Frances Cope** (1878–1959), an English immigrant from Derbyshire who had come to America as a young woman. The couple would remain together for fifty-six years until Robert's death.

By 1902, Robert and his brother William T. "Slim" Birch had established themselves in Prescott, Arizona Territory. Robert worked as a merchant, and the brothers became well-known figures in the pioneer community. Their father Joseph and mother Frances followed, settling in Prescott by 1906. The Birches were among the families who built Arizona before statehood in 1912.

Robert and Sarah had at least one child, a daughter **Mary Birch**, born in the late 1890s. Mary grew up between Prescott and the desert, eventually marrying Harold Carpenter at a memorable ceremony held at her father's resort on April 6, 1930.

Robert's most significant venture was the **Agua Caliente Hot Springs resort**, a 22-room hotel built around natural hot springs in the Gila River desert of Maricopa County, about fourteen miles from Sentinel. The therapeutic mineral baths drew visitors from across Arizona and beyond. The 1938 Arizona State Hotel Directory listed "Agua Caliente Hotel (Hot Springs) – Robert Birch" among the state's destinations.

The resort attracted notable guests. On March 20, 1927, **Governor George W. P. Hunt**—Arizona's first governor—visited Agua Caliente to tour the ruins of the historic King Woolsey home. A photograph preserved in the Arizona State Archives shows Hunt with Mary Birch, **Doris Higgins** (then three months pregnant with Howard), and others at the ruins, documenting the Birches' connection to Arizona's political establishment and the social circles that would intersect in Howard's story.

Around 1928, Robert and Sarah's lives took an unexpected turn. **Doris Kuthe**, a young woman from Oregon, had married a Mr. Higgins in Tucson in late 1926 and given birth to a son, **Howard Robert Higgins**, on September 15, 1927. By 1928, circumstances unknown led Doris to give up her infant son. The Birches—then in their late fifties with their daughter grown—took in the toddler and raised him as their own.

Though no formal adoption papers have surfaced, all evidence confirms that Howard became a Birch in every meaningful sense. He grew up at Agua Caliente with Robert and Sarah, attended school under the Birch name, and carried it into adulthood. When Howard married **Patricia Anne Mowrey** in Maricopa County on June 17, 1949, he did so as Howard R. Birch. The surname he received from Robert would pass to Howard's children and grandchildren—including the family member researching this history today.

Robert W. Birch died on August 6, 1950, in Phoenix, Arizona, at the age of eighty-one. His death certificate listed heart disease as the cause and his occupation as "retired merchant." He was buried in the Birch family mausoleum at Mountain View Cemetery in Prescott, alongside his parents, siblings, and eventually his wife Sarah, who died in 1959.

Howard Robert Birch—born Higgins—lived until 2019, dying at ninety-two. He carried both names as part of his identity, but in daily life he honored the man who raised him by using Birch. Robert's act of compassion in taking in a child in need created a family bond that endured across generations.

From his Canadian birth through the Arizona frontier to the desert hot springs, Robert W. Birch lived a life of enterprise and generosity. His legacy is preserved not only in Arizona's historical archives but in the family name he gave to a boy who was not his own.
