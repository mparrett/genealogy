### **Peter W. Mowrey (c. 1760–1840)**
**Relationship:** 5th great-grandfather (Mowrey line)

*Pennsylvania German, Appalachian Pioneer, Knox County Patriarch*

Peter W. Mowrey—also recorded as Johann Peter Maurer—was born around 1760, likely in Pennsylvania, to a family of German immigrants who had settled in the Philadelphia area during the mid-18th century. The surname Maurer (German for "mason") was gradually Anglicized to Mowrey/Mowery as the family moved through English-speaking frontier communities.

Peter married **Sophia Clapp** (1768–1829), and together they raised a family while participating in the great southward migration of Pennsylvania Germans into the Appalachian frontier. The family moved from Pennsylvania to Virginia, and eventually to Knox County, Tennessee, where they established themselves among the farming families of East Tennessee.

Peter and Sophia had several children, including sons **Samuel**, **Lewis**, and **Moses**. Their son Lewis R. Mowery (c. 1801–1850) would continue the family's westward trajectory, eventually sending descendants to Texas and Arizona.

Peter died in Knox County, Tennessee in 1840. His will, proved that year in Knox County, names his sons Samuel, Lewis, and Moses among the heirs—a crucial document that anchors the Mowrey family firmly in Tennessee and establishes the lineage connecting Pennsylvania German roots to Texas pioneers.

Sophia preceded him in death, passing in 1829.
