### **Peter W. Mowrey (c. 1760–1840)**
**Relationship:** 5th great-grandfather (Mowrey line)

*Pennsylvania German, Appalachian Pioneer, Knox County Patriarch*

Peter W. Mowrey—also recorded as Johann Peter Maurer—was born around 1760, likely in Pennsylvania, to a family of German immigrants who had settled in the Philadelphia area during the mid-18th century. The surname Maurer (German for "mason") was gradually Anglicized to Mowrey/Mowery as the family moved through English-speaking frontier communities.

Peter married **Sophia Clapp** (1768–1829), and together they raised a family while participating in the great southward migration of Pennsylvania Germans into the Appalachian frontier. The family moved from Pennsylvania to Virginia, and eventually to Knox County, Tennessee, where they established themselves among the farming families of East Tennessee.

Peter and Sophia had several children, including sons **Samuel**, **Lewis**, and **Moses**. Their son Lewis R. Mowery (c. 1801–1850) would continue the family's westward trajectory, eventually sending descendants to Texas and Arizona.

Peter died in Knox County, Tennessee in 1840. His will, proved that year in Knox County, names his sons Samuel, Lewis, and Moses among the heirs—a crucial document that anchors the Mowrey family firmly in Tennessee and establishes the lineage connecting Pennsylvania German roots to Texas pioneers.

Sophia preceded him in death, passing in 1829.

- **Possible father:** Peter Maurer, immigrated on ship *Edinburgh*, arrived Philadelphia Sept 16, 1751 (Pennsylvania Archives, 2nd series, "Names of Foreigners"). If our Peter was born c. 1760, the timeline fits for him to be a son of this immigrant.
- Marriage: to Sophia Clapp (1768–1829)
- Children: Samuel, Lewis R., Moses, and possibly others
- Death: 1840, Knox County, Tennessee
- Will: Proved 1840, Knox County, TN — names sons Samuel, Lewis, and Moses
- **Will location:** Knox County Estate Book v. 7-8 (1840-1844), FamilySearch Film 464121, DGS 4776046
- The Maurer/Mowrey surname transformation reflects the Anglicization common among Pennsylvania German families

### Research Gaps

- **Verify 1751 immigrant connection:** Is the Peter Maurer on the *Edinburgh* (1751) our Peter's father? Need PA church/tax/land records to confirm.
- **Extract the 1840 will:** Get verbatim text from Knox Estate Book v. 7-8 for names, witnesses, executor
- Parents' names and German origin (Rhineland?)
- Marriage date and location
- Complete list of children
- Migration timeline: PA → VA → TN
- Burial location in Knox County
