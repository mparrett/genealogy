## Biography of Moses Mansfield Mowery
**Relationship:** 3rd great-grandfather (Mowery line)

**Moses Mansfield Mowery** was born on **1 November 1822** in **Knox County, Tennessee**, likely the third of at least ten children born to **Lewis R. Mowery** and **Elizabeth "Betsy" Lisbee**[^1]. His middle name, *Mansfield*, was later passed down to one of his sons, suggesting family or ancestral significance.

The Mowery family moved to **Bradley County, Tennessee** around 1837[^2], and Moses came of age there. In about **1845**, he married **Margaret Elizabeth Witt**, a Tennessee native[^3]. Together they began a large family and soon joined the westward migration to Texas.

By 1853, they had passed briefly through Alabama and arrived in **Red River County, Texas**, settling on newly acquired farmland[^4].

Moses is listed among the **original landowners of Red River County**[^5], establishing himself as a farmer. The 1860 census shows him in Red River County with real estate and a growing family[^6]. Around 1870, Moses moved a few miles north to **Lamar County**, near the town of Milton, where he spent the rest of his life[^7]. He served as **postmaster of Milton** in the 1870s, a position later held by his son L. D. (Lewis Daily) Mowrey in the 1880s.

Moses and Margaret had **ten children**, many of whom carried family names[^8]:

- William R. Mowery  
- Ephraim Lusby Mowery  
- Lewis Daily Mowery  
- Moses G. Mowery  
- Sarah Elizabeth (Mowery) Sain  
- Elizabeth L. (Mowery) Allgood  
- Mary “Mollie” C. (Mowery) Allgood  
- Mansfield L. Mowery  
- Samuel S. Mowery  
- J. H. Mowery

These children and their descendants helped build the Mowery name into the fabric of Lamar County.

Moses was described in an 1889 Texas biography as "a substantial citizen of the county"[^9]. Margaret was still living with Moses in the 1900 census but died shortly thereafter (likely 1900–1903)[^10]. By 1904, widowed, Moses was living with his daughter Sarah and son-in-law John Sain in **Deport, Texas**. He passed away on **29 August 1904** — the same day as his son **Samuel S. Mowrey**, who also died in Lamar County at age 37[^11]. The cause of their simultaneous deaths is unknown; no newspaper account or death certificate has been found. Both are believed to be buried in **Milton Cemetery** (graves unmarked)[^12].

While earlier researchers were uncertain of his parentage, multiple sources now confirm Moses was indeed the son of **Lewis R. Mowery and Elizabeth (Lisbee) Mowery**[^13]. His brother, **Pleasant A. Mowrey**, is documented in Texas history as a son of Lewis and Elizabeth[^14], and Moses's children carried the Lisbee family name (rendered as "Lusby" in later records) and "Lewis" as middle names. 

*Note for researchers: The surname appears as both "Mowery" and "Mowrey" in various historical records, representing common spelling variations of the same family name.*

The family's journey from East Tennessee to the Red River valley reflects a common pioneer path — and Moses helped lay the foundations of the community that followed.
