  description: >
    Robert Birch was born in Ottawa in 1869, when the young Canadian capital
    was a lumber town being transformed by the construction of Parliament Hill.
    The Birch family left Canada in the late 19th century, beginning a journey
    that would take them to North Dakota and eventually Arizona.
