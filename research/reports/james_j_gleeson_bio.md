### **James J. Gleeson (1864–1946)**
**Relationship:** 2nd great-grandfather (Gleeson line)

*Irish Immigrant, Wisconsin Settler*

James Joseph Gleeson was born on December 21, 1864, in Ireland, to **Patrick Gleeson** and **Margaret Moloney**. The Gleeson surname is commonly associated with County Tipperary and surrounding areas in Ireland.

James immigrated to the United States around 1883, arriving in New York at approximately age 19. Like many Irish immigrants of his generation, he made his way to the Upper Midwest, eventually settling in Wisconsin.

On November 23, 1892, James married **Maria Ann Fitzgerald** in Mondovi, Buffalo County, Wisconsin. Maria was a Wisconsin native, born to Irish immigrant parents in Sauk County. Together they raised a family in the Mondovi area, where census records from 1900 through 1920 show them with multiple children.

Their daughter **Anne Barbara Gleeson** (1903–1986) was born in Mondovi. Anne would later move to Arizona, where she married **Raymond R. Mowrey** in 1930—establishing the family's Arizona roots that continue today.

Maria died in 1916 at approximately 51 years of age, leaving James a widower. James later remarried and continued living in the Upper Midwest. He died on January 28, 1946, in Waite Park, Stearns County, Minnesota, at the age of 81.

James J. Gleeson's life traced a path common to Irish-Americans of his era: emigrating from Ireland as a young man, building a life in the farmlands of Wisconsin, and watching his children scatter across the growing nation. Though he never lived in Arizona himself, his daughter Anne carried the family westward, planting roots in the desert Southwest.
