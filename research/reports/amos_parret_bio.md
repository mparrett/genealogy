### **Amos Parret (1820–1863)**
**Relationship:** 4th great-grandfather (Parrett line)

*Ohio Native, Indiana Merchant, Civil War Casualty*

Amos Parret was born in **1820** in **Preble County, Ohio**, the son of **Leonard Parrett** (1779–1854) and **Elizabeth House Haus Webb** (1785–1860). By 1830, the family was living in Perry, Richland County, Ohio.

### Marriage and Family

On **June 24, 1843**, Amos married **Mary Shelly** (1825–1907) in **Wabash County, Indiana**. Mary was born March 4, 1825 in Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, the daughter of Margaret Minnich. The couple settled near Dora in Wabash County before later moving to Andrews in Huntington County.

Together Amos and Mary had seven children:

- Martha E. Parrett (1845–1931) — born Andrews, Huntington County
- Joseph Leonard Parrett (1846–1928) — born Andrews
- Sarah J. Parrett (1848–1851) — died in infancy
- Mary Louise Parrett (1852–1929)
- Eliza Alida Sullivan (1854–1939)
- Amy "Annie" Clementine Parrett (1857–1944) — born Dora
- **John Anderson Parrett** (1859–1938) — *our direct ancestor*

### Career

Census records document Amos's occupational progression:

| Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1850 | Lagro, Wabash County | Farmer |
| 1860 | Dallas/Antioch, Huntington County | Merchant |

The shift from farming to mercantile work suggests Amos was part of the growing commercial class in northern Indiana during the canal and early railroad era.

### Civil War Service and Death

Amos enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War. His specific regiment has not been identified, though the **43rd Indiana Infantry** and **1st Indiana Cavalry** were stationed at Helena, Arkansas in 1863. His brothers also served—**James Parrott** died in 1855, and **Elias Parrott** died February 22, 1862 in Louisville, Kentucky.

Amos died on **September 24, 1863** in **Helena, Arkansas**, at age 43. With no combat recorded on that date, he likely succumbed to disease—Helena's military hospitals were overwhelmed with illness that year. Dysentery, typhoid, and malaria were rampant among troops stationed there.

His death left four-year-old John Anderson Parrett without a father. The U.S. Registers of Deaths of Volunteers, 1861–1865 confirms his military death, and his widow Mary successfully applied for a pension.

### Mary's Later Life

After Amos's death, Mary Shelly remarried to **Jonah Reeves Irey** (1817–1902) around 1863–1864. She had two more sons through this marriage:

- Lewis J. Irey (1864–1932)
- Samuel Meredith Irey (1868–1943)

Mary lived until **January 3, 1907**, dying in Huntington, Indiana at age 81. Her obituary in the *Daily News-Democrat* provided key details about the family's early years near Dora and Andrews.
