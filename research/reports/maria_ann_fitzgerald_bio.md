### **Maria Ann Fitzgerald (1865–1916)**
**Relationship:** 2nd great-grandmother (Gleeson line)

*Wisconsin Native, Daughter of Irish Immigrants*

Maria Ann Fitzgerald was born on July 3, 1865, in Ironton, Sauk County, Wisconsin. Though her surname and heritage were Irish, Maria herself was American-born—part of the first generation raised in Wisconsin by parents who had emigrated from Ireland.

The Fitzgerald surname is widespread across Ireland, with historic concentrations in the south and southwest. Maria's parents likely arrived in Wisconsin during the great waves of Irish immigration in the mid-19th century, settling in the farming communities of Sauk County.

On November 23, 1892, Maria married **James Joseph Gleeson**, an Irish immigrant living in Buffalo County, Wisconsin. The couple settled in Mondovi, where they raised their family. Their children included **Anne Barbara Gleeson** (1903–1986), who would later move to Arizona and marry into the Mowrey family.

Maria died in 1916 at approximately 51 years of age. The exact location and cause of her death are not yet confirmed, though it was likely in Wisconsin or Minnesota where the family had settled.

Maria Ann Fitzgerald's life was rooted in the Wisconsin heartland—born to Irish immigrants who sought new opportunities in America, she married another Irish descendant and raised the next generation on Midwestern soil. Her daughter Anne would carry the family story westward to Arizona.
