### **Adam Amos Parrett (1885–1959)**
**Relationship:** 2nd great-grandfather (Parrett line)

*Indiana Farm Boy, WWI Registrant, Cleveland Tradesman*

Adam Amos Parrett was born on **April 21, 1885** in **Wabash County, Indiana**, the eldest child of **John Anderson Parrett** (1859–1938) and **Mary Ellen Fisher** (1867–1953). He was named for his paternal grandfather Amos Parret, who had died in the Civil War over two decades earlier.

### Early Life in Lagro

Adam grew up on his father's farm near Lagro in Wabash County. The 1900 census shows him at age 15, still living with his parents and younger siblings. By 1908, he was working as a laborer in Marion, Indiana.

## Marriages and Family

Adam married three times:

**First Marriage:** On **August 19, 1906**, at age 21, Adam married **Mary Ann Beeks** (1889–1981) in **St. Joseph, Berrien County, Michigan**. Despite the out-of-state wedding, Mary Ann was also from Lagro—the daughter of Isaac Newton Beeks and Rebecca Susan Enyeart. The Michigan ceremony was likely an elopement. Together they had six children:

- **Charles Edward Parrett** (1908–1983) — *our direct ancestor*, born in Gas City, Indiana
- Gertrude P. Coy (1909–2010)
- Glenn Leroy Parrett (1911–2001)
- James Franklin "Jim" Parrett (1913–1951)
- Ferry Ellsworth Parrett (1916–1951)
- Hazel Irene Parrett (1919–2012)

Adam and Mary Ann divorced by 1921. Mary Ann remarried **Malen Ray North** on March 1, 1930 in Wabash, Indiana, and had three more children (Thelma, George, and John North). She lived until 1981, dying in Columbia City at age 92.

**Second Marriage:** On **April 23, 1921**, Adam married **Nettie Thompson O'Connor** (1884–1926) in **Cuyahoga County, Ohio**. Nettie was born in Cleveland. She died on July 17, 1926.

**Third Marriage:** Just a month after Nettie's death, on **August 14, 1926**, Adam married **Lillie Thompson Graham** (1879–1958) in Cuyahoga County. Lillie was Nettie's sister—both were Cleveland-born Thompsons who had been married to other men before Adam. Lillie died in Whiting, Kansas in 1958.

## World War I

Adam registered for the WWI draft in 1917–1918 while living in Whitley County, Indiana. At age 32–33, he was likely not called to serve, but his registration reflects the wartime mobilization that touched every American family.

## Career and Migration

Adam's occupational trajectory shows a man who worked with his hands throughout his life:

| Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1908 | Marion, Indiana | Laborer |
| 1910 | Lagro, Indiana | Laborer |
| 1917–18 | Whitley County, Indiana | (Draft registration) |
| 1920 | Cleveland Twp., Whitley Co., Indiana | Carpenter |
| 1923 | Cleveland, Ohio | Carpenter |
| 1926–40 | Cleveland, Ohio | Tool and Die Maker, Machine Repairman |
| 1950 | Cleveland, Ohio | (Head of household) |

Note: The 1920 census lists Adam in "Cleveland, Whitley, Indiana"—this is Cleveland Township in Whitley County, not Cleveland, Ohio. Adam moved to Cleveland, Ohio between 1920 and 1923. The family's migration from rural Indiana to industrial Cleveland reflected the broader movement of Americans seeking factory work in the early 20th century. Adam's progression from general laborer to skilled machinist shows his advancement in the trades.

## Family Tragedy

On **May 13, 1951**, Adam suffered a devastating loss when two of his sons drowned together in **Mud Lake** (now Nyona Lake) near Columbia City, Whitley County, Indiana. According to the *Columbia City Palladium-Item*, **James Franklin Parrett** (age 37) and **Ferry Ellsworth Parrett** (age 35) were setting a trotline when their boat capsized early Sunday morning. Their younger brother **Glenn** was with them and escaped by swimming to safety. Ferry's body was recovered at 2:30 a.m. and James's at 5:15 a.m.

## Later Years and Death

After his wife Lillie died in 1958, Adam returned to Indiana. He died on **October 21, 1959** in **Wabash, Indiana**, at age 74. He was buried in Wabash, Wabash County.
