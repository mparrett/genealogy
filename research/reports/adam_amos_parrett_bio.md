### **Adam Amos Parrett (1885–1959)**
**Relationship:** 2nd great-grandfather (Parrett line)

*Indiana Farm Boy, WWI Registrant, Cleveland Tradesman*

Adam Amos Parrett was born on **April 21, 1885** in **Wabash County, Indiana**, the eldest child of **John Anderson Parrett** (1859–1938) and **Mary Ellen Fisher** (1867–1953). He was named for his paternal grandfather Amos Parret, who had died in the Civil War over two decades earlier.

### Early Life in Lagro

Adam grew up on his father's farm near Lagro in Wabash County. The 1900 census shows him at age 15, still living with his parents and younger siblings. By 1908, he was working as a laborer in Marion, Indiana.

## Marriages and Family

Adam married three times:

**First Marriage:** On **August 19, 1906**, at age 21, Adam married **Mary Ann Beeks** in **St. Joseph, Berrien County, Michigan**. Together they had seven children:

- **Charles Edward Parrett** (1908–1983) — *our direct ancestor*, born in Gas City, Indiana
- Gertrude P. Coy (1909–2010)
- Glenn Leroy Parrett (1911–2001)
- James Franklin "Jim" Parrett (1913–1951)
- Ferry Ellsworth Parrett (1916–1951)
- Hazel Irene Parrett (1919–2012)

**Second Marriage:** On **April 23, 1921**, Adam married **Nettie Thompson O'Connor** (1881–1926) in **Cuyahoga County, Ohio**. Nettie died on July 17, 1926.

**Third Marriage:** Just a month after Nettie's death, on **August 14, 1926**, Adam married **Lillie Thompson Graham** (1878–1958) in Cuyahoga County. Lillie was apparently related to Nettie (both Thompsons). Lillie died in Whiting, Kansas in 1958.

## World War I

Adam registered for the WWI draft in 1917–1918 while living in Whitley County, Indiana. At age 32–33, he was likely not called to serve, but his registration reflects the wartime mobilization that touched every American family.

## Career and Migration

Adam's occupational trajectory shows a man who worked with his hands throughout his life:

| Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1908 | Marion, Indiana | Laborer |
| 1910 | Lagro, Indiana | Laborer |
| 1917–18 | Whitley County, Indiana | (Draft registration) |
| 1920–23 | Indiana → Cleveland, Ohio | Carpenter |
| 1926–40 | Cleveland, Ohio | Tool and Die Maker, Machine Repairman |
| 1950 | Cleveland, Ohio | (Head of household) |

The family's move from rural Indiana to industrial Cleveland reflected the broader migration of Americans seeking factory work in the early 20th century. Adam's progression from general laborer to skilled machinist shows his advancement in the trades.

## Family Tragedy

On **May 13, 1951**, Adam suffered a devastating loss when two of his sons—**James Franklin Parrett** (age 37) and **Ferry Ellsworth Parrett** (age 34)—drowned together in **Mud Lake** near Columbia City, Whitley County, Indiana. The brothers died the same day in what was likely a boating accident.

## Later Years and Death

After his wife Lillie died in 1958, Adam returned to Indiana. He died on **October 21, 1959** in **Wabash, Indiana**, at age 74. He was buried in Wabash, Wabash County.
