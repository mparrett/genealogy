# James Higgins (1830–1880)
**Relationship:** 3rd great-grandfather (Higgins line)

*Dublin Laborer, Father of Eleven*

James Higgins was born around 1830 in County Wicklow, Ireland—possibly in the Rathgar area near Dublin. He was one of at least eight children born to **Christopher Higgins** (1803–1857) and **Bridget Darcy** (1801–1896). His siblings included Thomas (1833–1898), Christopher (1834–1866), Mary (1837–1899), Ann (1837–1903), Catherine (1838–1882), Patrick (1839–), Mary Marcella (1840–), and Margaret (1840–).

James Higgins came of age during the worst catastrophe in modern Irish history. When the potato blight first struck in 1845, he was fifteen years old. By the time the famine ended in 1852, he was a married man with a child on the way—and Ireland had lost over two million people to death and emigration.

The famine struck hardest in the rural west, but Dublin and its suburbs felt the devastation too. Refugees flooded into the city from the countryside, overwhelming workhouses and filling the streets with the starving and sick. Typhus and relapsing fever—the "famine fevers"—killed nearly as many as starvation itself. The Higgins family in Harold's Cross would have witnessed this tide of misery firsthand.

County Wicklow, where James was likely born, saw its population drop by nearly 20% during the famine years. Whether any of his family members perished or emigrated during this period remains unknown, but the trauma shaped everyone who lived through it. The marriage of James and Jane in December 1850—as the worst was finally passing—marked the beginning of a new generation born into a changed Ireland.

Of their eleven children, only one would leave: **Laurence**, who emigrated to America in the 1880s. The rest stayed in Dublin, living and dying within a few miles of where they were born. But the famine cast a long shadow. The Ireland James knew as a boy—before the blight, before the coffin ships, before the mass graves—was gone forever.

On December 23, 1850, at age 20, James married **Jane Eustace** at Rathmines, Dublin. The witnesses were Patrick Delaney and Elizabeth Doyle. The young couple settled in the Harold's Cross area of Dublin, where James worked as a laborer.

James and Jane had eleven children over the next 23 years:

- **Christopher** (1851–1891)
- **Laurence** (1854–1930) — emigrated to America
- **James** (1856–1899)
- **Martin Thomas** (1858–1939)
- **Joseph** (1860–)
- **Edward** (1862–1872) — died at age 9
- **William** (1864–1892)
- **Michael** (1866–1867) — died in infancy
- **Mary Jane** (1867–1895)
- **Catherine Elizabeth** (1871–1873) — died at age 2
- **Edward** (1873–1914) — named for his deceased brother

The family lived at various addresses in Harold's Cross, including Loughawn and 6 Fulham's Lane. They experienced the sorrows common to 19th-century families: losing three children in childhood. Brother Christopher died in 1866 in Australia, at the Oriental Hotel in Sydney.

James Higgins died on May 10, 1880, in Harold's Cross, Ireland, at approximately age 50. He left behind his wife Jane and eight surviving children. Jane would outlive him by over 30 years, dying in 1911.

Through his son Laurence, who emigrated to America and married Mary Knight, James Higgins became an ancestor of the American Higgins line that eventually reached Arizona.
