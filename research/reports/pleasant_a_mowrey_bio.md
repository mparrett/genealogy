## Biography of Pleasant A. Mowrey
**Relationship:** 3rd great-granduncle (Mowery line) — brother of Moses Mansfield Mowery

*Tennessee Native, Texas Pioneer, Documented Family Member*

**Pleasant A. Mowrey** was born in Tennessee, likely in the 1820s or 1830s, and became one of the documented members of the Mowery family who made the westward journey to Texas[^1]. His story parallels that of his brother **Moses Mansfield Mowery**, representing the broader pattern of Tennessee families seeking new opportunities in the expanding Texas frontier.

### Family Background and Early Life

Pleasant was born to **Lewis R. Mowery**, a German immigrant, and **Elizabeth "Betsy" Lusby Mowery**, a Tennessee native[^2]. He was one of at least ten children in the family, growing up in the Tennessee counties of Knox and Bradley during the 1830s and 1840s. Like his siblings, Pleasant would have experienced the challenges and opportunities of frontier life in early Tennessee.

The family's move from Knox County to Bradley County around 1837 likely influenced Pleasant's later decision to continue westward to Texas, following the migration patterns common among Tennessee families of the era[^3].

### Migration to Texas

Pleasant A. Mowrey made his way to Texas, joining the tide of settlers who were drawn by land opportunities and the promise of new beginnings. His presence in Texas is documented in the *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* (1889), which confirms him as a son of Lewis and Elizabeth (Lisby) Mowrey[^4].

### Texas Life and Legacy

While specific details of Pleasant's Texas life remain to be researched, his documentation in Texas historical records suggests he established himself as a permanent resident and contributed to the development of his adopted state. His story represents the experiences of countless Tennessee families who helped build the foundations of Texas communities.

The spelling of his surname as "Mowrey" (rather than "Mowery" used by his brother Moses) reflects the common variations in family name documentation during this period, particularly as families moved between states and regions[^5].

### Connection to Brother Moses

Pleasant's relationship with his brother **Moses Mansfield Mowery** provides important confirmation of the family's Tennessee origins and Texas connections. Both brothers carried forward the family traditions established by their parents, Lewis and Elizabeth, while adapting to life on the Texas frontier.
