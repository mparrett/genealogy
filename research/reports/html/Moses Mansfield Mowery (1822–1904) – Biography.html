<h2>Biography of Moses Mansfield Mowery</h2>
<p><strong>Moses Mansfield Mowery</strong> was born in <strong>February 1822</strong> in <strong>Knox County, Tennessee</strong>, likely the third of at least ten children born to <strong>Lewis R. Mowery</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth “Betsy” Lusby</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. His middle name, <em>Mansfield</em>, was later passed down to one of his sons, suggesting family or ancestral significance.</p>
<p>The Mowery family moved to <strong>Bradley County, Tennessee</strong> around 1837<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, and Moses came of age there. In about <strong>1845</strong>, he married <strong>Margaret Elizabeth Witt</strong>, a Tennessee native<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. Together they began a large family and soon joined the westward migration to Texas. By 1853, they had passed briefly through Alabama and arrived in <strong>Red River County, Texas</strong>, settling on newly acquired farmland<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moses is listed among the <strong>original landowners of Red River County</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>, establishing himself as a farmer. The 1860 census shows him in Red River County with real estate and a growing family<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>. Around 1870, Moses moved a few miles north to <strong>Lamar County</strong>, near the town of Milton, where he spent the rest of his life<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moses and Margaret had <strong>ten children</strong>, many of whom carried family names<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>William R. Mowery</li>
<li>Ephraim Lusby Mowery</li>
<li>Lewis Daily Mowery</li>
<li>Moses G. Mowery</li>
<li>Sarah Elizabeth (Mowery) Sain</li>
<li>Elizabeth L. (Mowery) Allgood</li>
<li>Mary “Mollie” C. (Mowery) Allgood</li>
<li>Mansfield L. Mowery</li>
<li>Samuel S. Mowery</li>
<li>J. H. Mowery</li>
</ul>
<p>These children and their descendants helped build the Mowery name into the fabric of Lamar County.</p>
<p>Moses was described in an 1889 Texas biography as &quot;a substantial citizen of the county&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9">9</a></sup>. By 1900, widowed, he was living with his daughter Sarah and son-in-law John Sain in <strong>Deport, Texas</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-10"><a href="#fn-10">10</a></sup>. He passed away on <strong>29 August 1904</strong>, likely in Lamar County. Though his grave is unmarked, <strong>he is believed to be buried in Milton Cemetery</strong>, where many Mowery relatives rest<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-11"><a href="#fn-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While earlier researchers were uncertain of his parentage, multiple sources now confirm Moses was indeed the son of <strong>Lewis R. Mowery and Elizabeth (Lusby) Mowery</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-12"><a href="#fn-12">12</a></sup>. His brother, <strong>Pleasant A. Mowrey</strong>, is documented in Texas history as a son of Lewis and Elizabeth<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-13"><a href="#fn-13">13</a></sup>, and Moses’s children carried both Lusby and Lewis as middle names. The family’s journey from East Tennessee to the Red River valley reflects a common pioneer path — and Moses helped lay the foundations of the community that followed.</p>
