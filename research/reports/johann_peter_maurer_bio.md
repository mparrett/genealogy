# Johann Peter Maurer (1709–1781)
**Relationship:** 6th great-grandfather (Mowrey line)

*German Immigrant, Pennsylvania Pioneer, Progenitor of the Mowrey Line*

Johann Peter Maurer was born in **1709** in the Rhineland region of what was then Prussia, likely in or near **Baumholder**. He would become the immigrant ancestor who brought the Maurer family to America, where the surname would evolve into Mowrey/Mowery across subsequent generations.

## Marriage in Germany

On **February 27, 1738**, Johann Peter married **Anna Sophia Germann** (also recorded as Germannin) at the Evangelical Lutheran Church (Evangelisch-Lutherische) in **Baumholder, Rheinland, Prussia**. Together they would raise a large family, first in Germany and then in the New World.

## Immigration to America

In **1751**, Johann Peter Maurer brought his family to Pennsylvania aboard the ship *Edinburgh*, arriving in Philadelphia. The passenger manifest lists the household members:

- **Peter Maurer** (head)
- **Anna Sophia Germann Maurer** (wife)
- **Anna Catharina Maurer** (daughter)
- **Georg Ludwig Maurer** (son)
- **Maria Dorothea E. Maurer** (daughter)
- **Maria Elisabeth Maurer** (daughter)
- **Louisa Dorothea M. Maurer** (daughter)

Their son **Peter** (later Peter W. Mowrey) was born in Pennsylvania in 1760, nine years after the family's arrival—indicating they continued to grow their family in America.

Another son, **John Heinrich (Henry) Maurer**, was christened on September 20, 1753, at **Trapp Lutheran Church, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania**.

## Life in Pennsylvania

The Maurer family settled initially in the Philadelphia area, part of the large Pennsylvania German community that had been growing since the early 1700s. Like many German immigrants, they likely maintained their Lutheran faith and German language while gradually integrating into colonial American society.

At some point, part of the family migrated south to **Augusta County, Virginia**, where son Peter would later serve in the Revolutionary War militia. Johann Peter himself appears to have remained in Pennsylvania.

## Death and Estate

Johann Peter Maurer died before **September 10, 1781**, when his estate passed probate in **Lancaster, Pennsylvania**. The Lancaster County probate records document his will and the settlement of his estate.

His son Henry (John Heinrich) Maurer's will was later probated in July 1833 in Augusta County, Virginia, providing another link in the documentary chain connecting the Pennsylvania immigrants to the Tennessee and Texas Mowreys.

### Research Notes

German naming conventions can cause confusion: boys were almost always baptized with the first name Johannes (Johann), and girls with Maria or Anna. The "call name" (Rufname) was typically the second name. Thus "Johann Peter" was called Peter, and his son "Johann Peter" (Peter W. Mowrey) was also called Peter.
