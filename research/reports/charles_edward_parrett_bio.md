# Charles Edward Parrett (1908–1983)
**Relationship:** Great-grandfather (Parrett line)

*Indiana Native, Auto Mechanic, Family Man*

Charles Edward Parrett was born on **March 22, 1908** in **Gas City, Grant County, Indiana**, the eldest son of **Adam Amos Parrett** (1885–1959) and **Mary Ann Beeks** (1889–1981). He was the first of six children who survived to adulthood, and his life would span the transformation of rural Indiana from horse-and-buggy days to the automobile age—a transition he embraced as his life's work.

### Early Life

Charles grew up on the family farm near Lagro in Wabash County. The 1910 census shows him at age 2, living with his parents and infant sister Gertrude. By 1920, the family had moved to Cleveland Township in Whitley County, where his father worked as a carpenter. Charles was 12, surrounded by a growing brood of siblings: Gertrude, Glenn, James, Ferry, and baby Hazel.

His mother Mary Ann would later remarry Malen Ray North, giving Charles additional half-siblings: Thelma, George, and John North.

### Marriages and Family

Charles married four times, raising a large blended family across decades:

**First Marriage:** On **November 10, 1928**, at age 20, Charles married **Josephine Pittman King** (1907–1999) in Marion County, Indiana. Together they had five children:
- **James Edward Parrett** (1929–2000)
- **Mary Katherine Parrett** (1930–1993)
- **Robert Glenn Parrett Sr.** (1932–2018)
- **William Eugene Parrett** (1934–1999)
- Carl Leroy Parrett (1949–)

**Second Marriage:** On **July 2, 1937**, Charles married **Mary Ellen Sweeney** (1917–2001) in Porter, Indiana. They had one son:
- Dennis James Parrett (1938–)

**Third Marriage:** On **March 26, 1942**, Charles married **Grace Elizabeth Clark** (1922–2002) in Switzerland County, Indiana. They had one son:
- Lawrence Allen Parrett (1945–2011)

**Fourth Marriage:** On **October 19, 1946**, Charles married **Mary Elizabeth "Betty" Sherrow Preston** (1920–1996) in Union County, Indiana. Together they had:
- **Charles Eugene Parrett I** (1948–2017)
- Brenda Sue Parrett (1950–2008)

### World War II

Charles registered for the WWII draft in the early 1940s. At 32–34 years old with a family, he likely was not called to active service, but like his father before him in WWI, his registration reflects the wartime mobilization that touched every American household.

### Career

Charles made his living as an **auto mechanic**, a skilled trade that served him well through the Depression and postwar boom. His work history shows steady employment in the automotive industry:

| Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1940 | Columbia City, Indiana | (Census record) |
| 1947 | Richmond, Indiana | Mechanic |
| 1950 | Richmond, Indiana | Mechanic, Bob Ross Buick |
| 1958–60 | Richmond, Indiana | Mechanic |

By the late 1930s, Charles had settled in the Richmond area of Wayne County, where he would spend the rest of his life working on automobiles.

### Family Tragedy

On **May 13, 1951**, Charles lost two brothers in a single day. **James Franklin Parrett** (age 37) and **Ferry Ellsworth Parrett** (age 34) drowned together in **Mud Lake** near Columbia City. The brothers died in what was likely a boating accident—a devastating blow to the extended Parrett family.

### Later Years and Death

Charles continued working as a mechanic in Richmond through at least 1960. He outlived his father Adam (d. 1959) and his mother Mary Ann (d. 1981).

Charles Edward Parrett died on **March 20, 1983** in **Richmond, Wayne County, Indiana**, at age 74—just two days before what would have been his 75th birthday. He is buried in Richmond.
