# John Anderson Parrett (1859–1938)
**Relationship:** 3rd great-grandfather (Parrett line)

*Civil War Orphan, Indiana Farmer, Patriarch of the Parrett Family*

John Anderson Parrett was born on **May 1, 1859** in **Wabash County, Indiana**. His parents were **Amos Parret** (1820–1863) and **Mary Shelly** (1825–1907). Amos was born in Preble County, Ohio, the son of Leonard Parrett (1779–1854) and Elizabeth House Haus Webb (1785–1860). Mary was born in Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio. They married on **June 24, 1843** in Wabash County and lived near Dora before moving to Andrews.

### Childhood and Loss

John's early life was marked by the tragedy of the Civil War. His father Amos had been a farmer in Lagro (1850 census) before becoming a merchant in the Dallas/Antioch area of Huntington County by 1860. Amos died on **September 24, 1863** in **Helena, Arkansas**, when John was only four years old. He was serving in the Union Army—though his specific regiment has not been identified, the 43rd Indiana Infantry and 1st Indiana Cavalry were stationed at Helena in 1863. With no combat recorded on his death date, Amos likely succumbed to disease; Helena's military hospitals were overwhelmed with illness that year.

After Amos's death, Mary Shelly remarried to **Jonah Reeves Irey** (1817–1902). John gained half-brothers through this marriage: Lewis J. Irey (1864–1932) and Samuel Meredith Irey (1868–1943).

John had several full siblings from his parents' marriage:
- Martha E. Parrett (1845–1931)
- Joseph Leonard Parrett (1846–1928)
- Sarah J. Parrett (1848–1851) — died in infancy
- Mary Louise Parrett (1852–1929)
- Eliza Alida Sullivan (1854–1939)
- Amy "Annie" Clementine Parrett (1857–1944)

## Marriage and Family

On **April 1, 1884**, at age 24, John married **Mary Ellen Fisher** (1867–1953) in **Wabash, Indiana**. Together they raised six children:

- **Adam Amos Parrett** (1885–1959) — *our direct ancestor*
- Jesse Elsworth Parrett Sr. (1887–1969)
- Ferry Fisher Parrett (1890–1948)
- Nora Mabel Parrett (1898–1988)
- Martha Elizabeth "Minnie" Parrett (1901–1940)
- Edna E. Parrett (c. 1904–1963)

## Life in Wabash County

John spent most of his adult life in the Lagro area of Wabash County, Indiana. Census records document his occupations over the decades:

| Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1900 | Lagro, Wabash Co. | Farmer |
| 1910 | Lagro, Wabash Co. | Laborer |
| 1920 | Huntington (Ward 3) | Cashier |
| 1930 | Wabash | Plasterer |

The shift from farmer to laborer between 1900 and 1910 suggests John lost or sold the farm during this period, though no deeds or sheriff's sale notices have been found. Economic pressures of the era likely drove his varied career path.

By 1920, John was living in Huntington, listed as a widower working as a cashier—though Mary Ellen Fisher actually lived until 1953. No divorce record has been located, and Mary Ellen's obituary still refers to her as John's wife. The 1920 "widower" designation was likely a census error.

## Second Marriage

Despite the missing divorce record, John married **Medora Alice Kuldau** (1863–1935) on **July 29, 1926** in Wabash, Indiana—suggesting he and Mary Ellen had quietly divorced by then. He was 67 years old. Medora died in 1935.

## Death

John Anderson Parrett died on **June 27, 1938** in **Noble Township, Wabash County, Indiana**, at age 79. He was buried in **Lagro Township Cemetery**, Wabash County.
