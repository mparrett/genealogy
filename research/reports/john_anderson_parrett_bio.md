### **John Anderson Parrett (1859–1938)**
**Relationship:** 3rd great-grandfather (Parrett line)

*Civil War Orphan, Indiana Farmer, Patriarch of the Parrett Family*

John Anderson Parrett was born on **May 1, 1859** in **Wabash County, Indiana**, likely near South Whitley in Whitley County. His parents were **Amos Parret** (1820–1863) and **Mary Shelly** (1825–1907).

## Childhood and Loss

John's early life was marked by the tragedy of the Civil War. His father Amos died on **September 24, 1863** in **Helena, Arkansas**, when John was only four years old. Amos was likely serving in the Union Army, as Helena was a major Union supply depot and saw significant military activity.

After Amos's death, Mary Shelly remarried to **Jonah Reeves Irey** (1817–1902). John gained half-brothers through this marriage: Lewis J. Irey (1864–1932) and Samuel Meredith Irey (1868–1943).

John had several full siblings from his parents' marriage:
- Martha E. Parrett (1845–1931)
- Joseph Leonard Parrett (1846–1928)
- Mary Louise Parrett (1852–1929)
- Eliza Alida Sullivan (1854–1939)
- Amy "Annie" Clementine Parrett (1857–1944)

## Marriage and Family

On **April 1, 1884**, at age 24, John married **Mary Ellen Fisher** (1867–1953) in **Wabash, Indiana**. Together they raised six children:

- **Adam Amos Parrett** (1885–1959) — *our direct ancestor*
- Jesse Elsworth Parrett Sr. (1887–1969)
- Ferry Fisher Parrett (1890–1948)
- Nora Mabel Parrett (1898–1988)
- Martha Elizabeth "Minnie" Parrett (1901–1940)
- Edna E. Parrett (c. 1904–1963)

## Life in Wabash County

John spent most of his adult life in the Lagro area of Wabash County, Indiana. Census records document his occupations over the decades:

| Year | Location | Occupation |
|------|----------|------------|
| 1900 | Lagro, Wabash Co. | Farmer |
| 1910 | Lagro, Wabash Co. | Laborer |
| 1920 | Huntington (Ward 3) | Cashier |
| 1930 | Wabash | Plasterer |

By 1920, John was living in Huntington with family, listed as a widower working as a cashier—though Mary Ellen Fisher actually lived until 1953, so the "widowed" status may be a census error or they may have been temporarily separated.

## Second Marriage

After Mary Ellen's death (or possibly earlier separation), John married **Medora Alice Kuldau** (1863–1935) on **July 29, 1926** in Wabash, Indiana. He was 67 years old. Medora died in 1935.

## Death

John Anderson Parrett died on **June 27, 1938** in **Noble Township, Wabash County, Indiana**, at age 79. He was buried in **Lagro Township Cemetery**, Wabash County.
