### **Lewis R. Mowery (c. 1801–c. 1850)**
**Relationship:** 4th great-grandfather (Mowery line)

*Tennessee Farmer, Family Patriarch, the One Who Didn't Go West*

Lewis R. Mowery was born around 1801 in Knox County, Tennessee, the son of **Peter W. Mowrey** (Johann Peter Maurer, 1760–1840) and **Sophia Clapp** (1768–1829). For generations, family lore described Lewis as a "German immigrant"—but the truth was more nuanced. Lewis was American-born; it was his father Peter who carried the German heritage, descending from Rhineland immigrants who had settled in Philadelphia County in the mid-1700s. The surname itself tells the story: Mowery is an Anglicization of the German "Maurer," transformed on the American frontier as the family moved south from Pennsylvania through Virginia to the Tennessee hills.

Lewis grew up in the Appalachian foothills of East Tennessee, where his father farmed land in Knox County. Peter Mowrey died there in 1840, his will naming sons Samuel, Lewis, and Moses among his heirs—a document that anchors the family firmly in Tennessee soil, not German ports.

On March 3, 1819, at about eighteen years old, Lewis married **Elizabeth "Betsy" Lisbee** in Knox County. Elizabeth was the daughter of Moses Lisbee and Lucy, early settlers in the region. The young couple would raise a large family of at least ten children over the following decades, including **Moses Mansfield Mowery** (1822–1904), Pleasant A. Mowrey, Ephraim Lusby Mowery (who carried his mother's family name), and Lewis Daily Mowery (named for his father).

Around 1837, Lewis moved his growing family from Knox County to Bradley County in southeast Tennessee, following a common pattern among Knox County families seeking better farmland. The 1840 census confirms him there as head of household, farming the rich land of the Tennessee Valley.

But Lewis would not live to see his children become Texas pioneers. He died around 1850—the exact date and place uncertain, though the *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* records simply that "Louis Mowrey died in 1850." He does not appear in the 1850 census. Some sources suggest he may have died en route to Texas or in Arkansas, but no death or probate record has surfaced outside Tennessee. The most likely scenario is that he died in Tennessee, just as his sons were beginning to look westward.

Elizabeth survived her husband by nine years. By 1853, their son Moses had settled in Red River County, Texas, and other children followed. Elizabeth eventually joined them, dying in Lamar County, Texas, in 1859. Pleasant A. Mowrey reportedly "reached Texas the year of his mother's death"—suggesting Elizabeth may have traveled west with her youngest, only to die soon after arriving.

Lewis R. Mowery was the patriarch who built the family but didn't live to see where it would go. His sons established the Milton community in Lamar County, Texas, where Moses served as postmaster and the Mowery name took root. Generations later, that Texas branch would make its way to Arizona, where Lewis's descendants became well-known figures in Williams—a long arc from the Tennessee frontier to the American Southwest.
