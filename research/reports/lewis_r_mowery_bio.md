## Biography of Lewis R. Mowery
**Relationship:** 4th great-grandfather (Mowery line)

*Tennessee Pioneer, Farmer, Family Patriarch*

**Lewis R. Mowery** was born about 1801 in Knox County, Tennessee, the son of **Peter W. Mowrey** (Johann Peter Maurer, 1760–1840) and **Sophia Clapp** (1768–1829)[^1]. Though long described in family lore as a "German immigrant," Lewis was in fact American-born — it was his father Peter who brought the German heritage from Pennsylvania to the Tennessee frontier. The surname Mowery/Mowrey is an Anglicized form of the German "Maurer."

### Family Origins

Lewis's father, Peter W. Mowrey, was of Pennsylvania German stock, descended from Rhineland immigrants who settled in Philadelphia County in the mid-1700s[^2]. Peter and Sophia migrated south through Virginia to Knox County, Tennessee, where Peter died in 1840. His will, proved that year in Knox County, names sons Samuel, Lewis, and Moses among his heirs[^3].

### Marriage and Settlement

On **3 March 1819**, Lewis married **Elizabeth "Betsy" Lisbee** in Knox County, Tennessee[^4]. Elizabeth was the daughter of **Moses Lisbee** and **Lucy [?]** of Knox County[^5]. Together they raised a large family of at least ten children, including:

- **Moses Mansfield Mowery** (1822–1904) — Tennessee farmer, Texas pioneer
- **Pleasant A. Mowrey** — Later documented in Texas historical records
- **Ephraim Lusby Mowery** — Carried his mother's family name as middle name
- **Lewis Daily Mowery** — Named after his father
- *[Additional children to be researched and documented]*

### Move to Bradley County

Around 1837, the family moved from Knox County to **Bradley County, Tennessee**. The 1840 U.S. Census confirms Lewis Mowery as a head of household in Bradley County[^6]. This move to southeast Tennessee followed a common pattern among Knox County families seeking better farmland.

### Death

Lewis died around **1850**, likely in Tennessee[^7]. He does not appear in the 1850 census, and the *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* (1889) states that he "died in 1850." Some genealogical sources suggest he may have died en route to Texas or in Arkansas, but no death or probate record has been found outside Tennessee. His wife Elizabeth survived him by nine years, eventually joining their children in Texas before her death in 1859.
