### **Jane Eustace (1829–1911)**
**Relationship:** 3rd great-grandmother (Higgins line)

*Dublin Mother, Widow Who Outlived Her Children*

Jane Eustace was born on April 20, 1829, in Rathfarnham, a village on the southern outskirts of Dublin, Ireland. She was baptized that same day. Her parents were **Patrick Eustace** (1798–1866) and **Margaret Conlon** (1801–1881). Jane had at least three siblings: James (1832–), Michael (1833–), and Anne (1836–1885).

On December 23, 1850, at age 21, Jane married **James Higgins** at Rathmines, Dublin. The witnesses were Patrick Delaney and Elizabeth Doyle. A note in the baptismal records mentions the name "Doyle," suggesting a possible connection to the witness.

Jane and James settled in the Harold's Cross area of Dublin, where they raised a large family. Over 23 years, Jane gave birth to eleven children:

- **Christopher** (1851–1891)
- **Laurence** (1854–1930) — emigrated to America
- **James** (1856–1899)
- **Martin Thomas** (1858–1939)
- **Joseph** (1860–)
- **Edward** (1862–1872) — died at age 9
- **William** (1864–1892)
- **Michael** (1866–1867) — died in infancy
- **Mary Jane** (1867–1895)
- **Catherine Elizabeth** (1871–1873) — died at age 2
- **Edward** (1873–1914) — named for his deceased brother

The family lived at addresses including Loughawn and 6 Fulham's Lane in Harold's Cross. Jane experienced the hardships common to 19th-century mothers: three of her children died in childhood, and she would outlive several more.

Jane's father Patrick Eustace died in 1866. Her husband James died on May 10, 1880, leaving Jane a widow at 51 with eight surviving children still living. Her mother Margaret Conlon died the following year, in May 1881, at 5 Rathmines Avenue—the same address where Jane's sister Anne would die in 1885.

The 1890s brought more loss. Son Christopher died in England in 1891. Son William died in 1892 at the South Dublin Union Workhouse. Daughter Mary Jane died in 1895 at Harold's Cross Hospice. Son James died in 1899 at Watling Street, Dublin.

Jane Eustace Higgins died on October 23, 1911, in Dublin South, Ireland, at age 82—having outlived her husband by 31 years and having buried at least seven of her eleven children.

Through her son Laurence, who emigrated to America and married Mary Knight, Jane Eustace became an ancestor of the American Higgins line that continues today.
