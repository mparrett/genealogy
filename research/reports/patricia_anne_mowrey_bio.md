# Patricia Anne Mowrey (1929–2009)
**Relationship:** 1st great-grandmother (Mowrey line)

*Williams Girl, College Graduate, Arizona Matriarch*

Patricia Anne Mowrey was born on **February 5, 1929** in **Williams, Coconino County, Arizona**, the only child of **Raymond Robert Mowrey** (1899–1973) and **Anne Barbara Gleeson** (1903–1986). She grew up in the small railroad town of Williams, nestled in the ponderosa pine forests below the San Francisco Peaks.

### Childhood in Williams

Patricia spent her formative years in Williams, appearing in the 1930 and 1940 censuses as a daughter in the Mowrey household. A 1934 newspaper clipping notes that "Mrs. Raymond Mowrey and daughter Patricia" left for a visit—evidence of the family's connections beyond their Arizona home. The family also spent time in Tucson, where they appear in 1941 city directories.

### Education

Patricia graduated from **Williams High School** before heading east to **Stephens College** in Columbia, Missouri, where she was a student in 1947–1948. Stephens was a prestigious women's college known for its arts and communications programs. City directories confirm her residence in Columbia during these years.

### Marriage and Family

On **June 17, 1949**, Patricia married **Howard Robert Higgins Birch** (1927–2019) at **St. Frances Xavier Church** in Phoenix, Arizona. She was 20 years old. The *Arizona Republic* announced the wedding on June 18th and again on June 30th.

Together Patricia and Howard raised three children:

- **Michele Anne Birch** (1951–)
- **Melanie Doris Birch Garliepp** (1953–)
- **Michael K. Birch** (1958–2010)

### Life Across the Country

The Birch family moved frequently, following Howard's career:
