# Deep Research: Higgins/Knight Line — Unresolved Questions

Building on initial research. Need help resolving specific confusions and going deeper on Irish origins. Web sources only.

## Priority 1: The Mary Knight / Laurence Higgins Timeline Problem

**The confusion:**
- Mary Knight (née) Higgins died **27 Mar 1930** in a New York almshouse
- She was listed as **"widowed"** at admission (17 Feb 1930)
- But Laurence Higgins supposedly died in **1940**

**Possible explanations:**
1. Laurence's death date (1940) is wrong — he died before 1930
2. They were separated/divorced
3. The Mary Higgins in the almshouse is a different person
4. "Widowed" was recorded in error

**What I need:**
- Death record for Laurence Higgins — when and where did he actually die?
- Marriage record for Laurence Higgins + Mary Knight — when/where?
- Census records 1900, 1910, 1920 showing them together (or not)
- Any divorce records?
- Confirm the almshouse Mary Higgins is the same as Mary Knight

## Priority 2: Howard R. Higgins Birch — The Dual Surname

**The confusion:**
- Howard R. Higgins Birch (1922–2019) was son of James E. Higgins + Doris Kuthe
- His children carry surname "Birch" not "Higgins"
- Why both surnames? Adoption? Mother remarried?

**What I need:**
- Did Doris Kuthe remarry after James E. Higgins died (1938)?
- Marriage record for Doris to someone named "Birch"?
- When did the Birch surname get attached to Howard?
- Was Howard legally adopted by a Birch?

**Timeline to check:**
- James E. Higgins dies 1938 (Howard is ~16)
- Doris would have been widowed with a teenage son
- Did she remarry?

## Priority 3: James E. Higgins — Path to Arizona

**Questions:**
- Born 1892 — where? (New York? Based on parents' location)
- Census records 1900, 1910, 1920 — where was he living?
- How/why did he end up in Phoenix, Arizona by 1926?
- Did he follow the Kuthe family there? (George Kuthe moved to Phoenix after 1907)
- What was his occupation?
- Death 1938 — where, cause of death?
- What does the "E" stand for? (Everett? Edward? Eugene?)

## Priority 4: Irish Origins

### Higgins family
- Laurence born c. 1854 — Ireland? What county?
- Parents' names?
- Higgins is common in Ireland — any clues to narrow down (Mayo, Sligo, Clare are common)

### Knight family
- Mary's parents: James Knight + Bridget Larney
- Any records for them in Ireland or US?
- What county in Ireland?
- Larney/Larne suggests possible Ulster connection?

## Priority 5: New York Connections

Based on Mary's death in NYC and possible family base there:
- Search for Higgins/Knight in New York census records
- Any other Higgins or Knight family members in NYC area?
- Church records (likely Catholic given Irish background)

## Specific Records to Find

1. **Laurence Higgins death record** — critical to resolve the 1930/1940 conflict
2. **Laurence + Mary marriage record** — where/when married
3. **1900/1910/1920 census** for Higgins household
4. **James E. Higgins death certificate** (1938) — Arizona?
5. **Doris Kuthe remarriage record** — if she married someone named Birch
6. **Howard R. Higgins birth certificate** — does it show Higgins or Birch?

## Constraints

- Web-only research
