## Research Strategy Notes

### Newspaper Search Best Practices
- Use variant spellings: "Berch" vs "Birch", "Doris Higgens" vs "Higgins"
- Search date ranges, not just exact dates (events reported days later)
- Check social columns, legal notices, AND news sections
- Local papers (Douglas, Yuma) sometimes covered Agua Caliente more than Phoenix/Tucson

### Census Challenges
- Agua Caliente was VERY remote - enumerator may have missed it or misspelled names
- Check neighboring precincts (Sentinel, Gila Bend)
- 1930 Census taken April 1930 - right after Mary Birch's wedding, Howard would be 2.5 years old

### Railroad Record Tips
- SP and WP records scattered across multiple repositories
- Many employment records destroyed or incomplete
- Timetables easier to find than personnel records
- Check railroad historical societies (enthusiasts often have better archives than official ones)
