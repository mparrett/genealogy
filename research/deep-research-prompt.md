# Deep Research: Mowery/Mowrey Family — Lamar County, Texas

Thanks for the initial verification — it was very helpful. I'd like you to go deeper on a few threads. Use deep research mode if available.

## What we've confirmed so far

- **Lewis R. Mowery** married **Betsy Lisbee** on 3 March 1819, Knox County, TN (marriage record transcription in *Tennessee Historical Magazine* via Internet Archive)
- **Moses Mansfield Mowery** (1822–1904) died **29 Aug 1904**, Lamar County, TX (WikiTree, Find a Grave)
- **Margaret Elizabeth Witt** was Moses's wife, married c. 1845
- **Samuel H/S Mowrey** (1867–1904) married Effie May Coker 12 June 1897; died 1904 (possibly also 29 Aug)
- Family settled in **Red River County, TX** by 1853, then **Lamar County, TX** (Milton community) by 1870
- Moses is buried (unmarked) in **Milton Cemetery**, Lamar County

## Priority 1: The 29 August 1904 deaths

Moses and Samuel may have died **the same day**. This is the biggest open question.

Please search for:
- **Texas death certificates** or county death register entries for Moses Mowery and Samuel Mowrey in Lamar County, Aug/Sept 1904
- **Newspaper obituaries** from Paris, TX newspapers (Paris Morning News, North Texan, Lamar County Echo) around late Aug / early Sept 1904
- **Milton Cemetery** records or surveys — any Mowery/Mowrey graves documented?
- Was there any **epidemic, storm, or notable event** in Lamar County TX in August 1904?
- If they died the same day, could this be a **farming accident**, **flooding**, or **disease outbreak**?
- Or is the shared date likely **data propagation** (one person's date copied to the other in online trees)?

## Priority 2: Margaret Elizabeth Witt (c. 1828–1900/1904)

Her death year is disputed (WikiTree says ~1900, Geni says 1904). Moses's 1900 census says he's a widower — can you confirm?

- If Margaret died before 1900, when? Any **Find a Grave** or cemetery record?
- Is she also buried at **Milton Cemetery**?
- Where was she from? Any Witt family records in Tennessee?
- **Marriage record** for Moses Mowery + Margaret Witt, c. 1845 — which Tennessee county?

## Priority 3: Lewis R. Mowery — origins

The claim that Lewis was a "German immigrant" is not primary-confirmed. The 1900 census for Moses says both parents born in Tennessee.

- Are there any **immigration, naturalization, or ship manifest** records for a Lewis Mowery/Mowry arriving from Germany?
- Any **census records** (1820, 1830, 1840) showing Lewis Mowery in Knox or Bradley County, TN?
- The 1840 census in **Bradley County** should show the family — what does it say about ages/household composition?
- Is "Mowery" a surname of German origin, or could it be Scots-Irish?

## Priority 4: The 1859 deaths (Lewis + Elizabeth)

Both reportedly died 1859. If they were in Texas by then (following their sons), yellow fever is plausible.

- Any **Texas death records** or **probate records** for Lewis Mowery, 1859?
- Were Lewis and Elizabeth in Texas, or did they stay in Tennessee?
- Any **census record** (1850) showing Lewis and Elizabeth — where were they living?

## Priority 5: Samuel's full name

Middle initial shows as "S" in some sources, "H" in FamilySearch.

- Can you find his **1897 marriage record** (to Effie May Coker) — which county, and what name is listed?
- Any **birth record** or **christening record** for Samuel in Lamar County, c. 1867?
- The *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* (1889, p. 622) lists Moses's children — does it give Samuel's middle name?

## Priority 6: The Lisbee family

Elizabeth's maiden name "Lisbee" is unusual.

- Any other **Lisbee** families in Knox County, TN records (1790s–1820s)?
- Could "Lisbee" be a variant of another surname (Lisby, Lisbie, Lesby)?
- Any **estate/probate records** for a Lisbee family in Knox County?

## Context for searching

- **Key locations:** Knox County TN → Bradley County TN → Red River County TX → Lamar County TX (Milton community, near Deport)
- **Key timeframe:** 1819–1904
- **Available source:** *Biographical Souvenir of the State of Texas* (1889), p. 622 — has biographical entry for Moses
- **Surname variants:** Mowery, Mowrey, Mowry, Moury (all same family)
- **Milton Cemetery**, Lamar County, TX — family burial site
