## Notes

- Red/green dots on photos indicate deceased/living status

- Howard R. Higgins Birch — surname appears as both "Higgins" (from father James E. Higgins) and "Birch" (the surname carried by his children Michele, Melanie, Michael)
- Samuel's middle initial: shown as "S" in Ancestry tree, but FamilySearch records suggest "H" — needs primary-source confirmation
- Chart covers 7 generations (with Mowrey line extended to 4th great-grandparents)
