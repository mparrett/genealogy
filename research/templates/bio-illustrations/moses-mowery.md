## Stage 3: Image Prompts

### Image 1: Westward Migration (1850s)

```
A watercolor depicting a pioneer family's westward journey from Tennessee to Texas in the 1850s. A covered wagon on a dusty trail, crossing rolling prairie or a river ford. A family with young children — the father on horseback or walking alongside. The mood is determined, hopeful, adventurous. Distant Texas horizon. Warm afternoon light, dust in the air.

### Image 2: Texas Homestead (1870s-1880s)

```
A watercolor of a Texas Red River valley farmstead in the 1870s-1880s. A sturdy wooden farmhouse with a wide porch, cotton or corn fields nearby, split-rail fencing. The flat Texas prairie stretches to the horizon under a big sky. A few farm buildings, perhaps a windmill. Children or farmhands at work. Late afternoon golden light. The mood is established, prosperous, rooted in the land.
