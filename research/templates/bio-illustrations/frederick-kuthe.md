## Stage 3: Image Prompts

### Image 1: The Voyage (1845)

```
A watercolor depicting the emigration journey: a 19th-century sailing ship on the Atlantic, viewed from the deck or at an angle showing the vessel against an expansive sea and sky. Hints of passengers on deck — a young German family looking toward the horizon. The mood is hopeful but uncertain. Bremen harbor fading in the background or New Orleans approaching. Soft morning or evening light.

### Image 2: Missouri Homestead (1870s)

```
A watercolor of a modest Missouri Ozark farmstead in the 1870s. A simple wooden farmhouse with a German immigrant family's character — perhaps a kitchen garden, split-rail fence, a few children in the yard. Rolling Ozark hills with oak and hickory trees in the background. Late afternoon golden light. The mood is quiet, hardworking, rooted.
