## Stage 3: Image Prompts

### Image 1: Famine Emigration (early 1850s)

```
A watercolor depicting Irish emigrants leaving County Limerick during the Great Famine era (early 1850s). A rural Irish landscape with stone walls and a humble cottage being left behind. A family with their few possessions walking toward a distant harbor or ship. The mood is somber but determined — leaving hardship behind, facing an uncertain future. Overcast sky, muted greens and grays of the Irish countryside. Hints of the poverty and desperation of the famine years.

### Image 2: Wisconsin Farmstead (1870s)

```
A watercolor of an Irish immigrant family's Wisconsin farmstead in the 1870s. A modest but sturdy farmhouse with cleared fields in the rolling hills of Sauk or Buffalo County. Split-rail fencing, a small barn, perhaps a kitchen garden. The landscape shows the Upper Midwest character — deciduous forest mixed with farmland, gentler than the prairie. Late afternoon light. The mood is established, hopeful — the family has built something from nothing. A sense of the tight-knit Irish Catholic community in rural Wisconsin.
