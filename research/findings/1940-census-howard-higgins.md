## Critical Findings

### 1. Previous Residence Confirms Agua Caliente
**"Agnes Calienta, Maricopa, Arizona" (April 1935)**
- Clear typo/misspelling of "Agua Caliente"
- **Confirms Howard was living at the resort in April 1935** when he was 7-8 years old
- This is 5 years before the census, when Robert Birch was still operating the hotel

### 2. Listed as "Lodger" - NOT "Son" or "Adopted Son"
**Major Question:** Why is Howard a lodger with the Woodard family instead of living with Robert & Sarah Birch?

**Possible explanations:**
- Robert & Sarah were aging (Robert 71, Sarah 62 in 1940)
- The resort may have been struggling/closing by late 1930s
- The Birches may have moved Howard to Phoenix for better schooling
- He may have been boarding for school while Birches remained at Agua Caliente
- The Birches may have moved to Phoenix and placed Howard with the Woodards temporarily

### 3. Birth Year Error
**Listed as 1928, actual birth September 9, 1927**
- Off by approximately 1 year
- Common census error (age vs birth year rounding)
- Enumerator likely asked "how old is he" and got "12" (he turned 13 in Sept 1940)

### 4. The Move to Phoenix (1935-1940)
**Timeline:**
- **April 1935:** Living at Agua Caliente with Robert & Sarah Birch (presumably)
- **Sometime 1935-1940:** Moved to Phoenix, living with Woodard family
- **April 1940:** Enrolled in Phoenix schools, 6th grade

**Questions:**
- When exactly did the move happen?
- Did Robert & Sarah move to Phoenix too, or stay at Agua Caliente?
- How did the Birches know the Woodard family?
- Was this temporary (school year boarding) or permanent?

## Key Mysteries This Raises

### 1. Where Were Robert & Sarah Birch in 1940?
**We need to find:**
- 1940 Census for Robert W. Birch (age 71) and Sarah F. Birch (age 62)
- Were they still at Agua Caliente? In Phoenix? In Prescott?
- Did they move Howard to Phoenix for school but stay at the resort?

### 2. Connection Between Birches and Woodards
**How did this placement happen?**
- Family friends?
- Business connection (R. Waldo was a "manager" - of what?)
- Through Mary Birch Carpenter (who lived in Phoenix after her 1930 marriage)?
- Arizona social networks?

### 3. Howard's Status
**Why "lodger" and not "ward" or "adopted son"?**
- Was this a boarding arrangement for school?
- Did the Birches pay the Woodards to house him?
- Was this temporary or the new permanent arrangement?
- Did Howard still identify as a Birch, or was he using "Higgins" socially?

### 4. Elsie Parkman - Art Teacher
**Potential lead:**
- Government employee (likely Phoenix school system)
- College-educated, single, 35
- May have had connection to Howard's education
- Could she have been Howard's teacher and arranged the lodging?

### 5. The 1935 Residence
**"Agnes Calienta" confirms:**
- Howard was definitely at Agua Caliente in April 1935
- He was 7-8 years old
- Robert & Sarah were likely still operating the resort
- The move to Phoenix happened sometime between April 1935 and April 1940

## Research Action Items

### Immediate Priorities:
- [ ] Find Robert W. Birch in 1940 Census (search Phoenix, Agua Caliente, Prescott)
- [ ] Find Sarah F. Birch in 1940 Census
- [ ] Research R. Waldo Woodard - who was he? What did he manage?
- [ ] Research Elsie Parkman - Phoenix school system records, teaching career
- [ ] Phoenix city directories 1935-1940 (trace Woodard family, look for Birch family)
- [ ] Phoenix school records - which school did Howard attend?

### Secondary Questions:
- [ ] When did Agua Caliente resort close? (We thought early 1940s, but maybe earlier?)
- [ ] Mary Birch Carpenter connection to Woodards? (she lived in Phoenix)
- [ ] Howard's schooling records in Phoenix
- [ ] Did Howard continue living with Woodards after 1940, or move back to Birches?

**Source:** U.S., School Yearbooks, 1880-2012 (Ancestry.com)
**School:** North High School, Phoenix, Arizona
**Year:** 1944
**Name:** Howard R Higgins
**Estimated Age:** 16 (birth year listed as abt 1928 - still incorrect, actual birth Sept 9, 1927, so he was actually 16-17 in 1944)
**Picture:** Yes (yearbook photo exists)

**Citation:** "U.S., School Yearbooks, 1880-2012"; School Name: North High School; Year: 1944

**Significance:**
- Confirms Howard remained in Phoenix through high school
- Still using surname "Higgins" in 1944 (age 16-17)
- Attending North High School (established 1923, located at 1010 E. Thomas Rd)
- If 1944 yearbook shows him, likely sophomore or junior year
- Would have graduated circa 1945-1946

**Questions:**
- Did he graduate as "Howard Higgins" or "Howard Birch"?
- When did he officially start using "Birch" as his surname?
- Was he still living with the Woodards in 1944, or had he moved back to the Birches?
- Where were Robert & Sarah Birch during his high school years?

## Significance

This census record is **critical evidence** because it:

1. **Confirms Howard lived at Agua Caliente** through at least April 1935
2. **Documents the transition from desert resort to Phoenix city life**
3. **Raises questions about the Birch family's situation in the late 1930s**
4. **Shows Howard was being raised in an educated, middle-class household** by 1940
5. **Provides new research leads** (Woodard, Parkman families)

The "lodger" designation is particularly interesting - it suggests a **formal boarding arrangement** rather than informal adoption. This may have been:
- Educational boarding (Phoenix had better schools than remote Agua Caliente)
- Temporary care while Birches dealt with resort closure/aging
- Arranged through Mary Birch Carpenter (Phoenix resident since 1930)

**Next step:** Find the 1940 Census record for Robert & Sarah Birch to understand their situation at this time.
