# Research Findings

This directory contains person-specific research discoveries and verified facts.

## Directory Structure

```
research/findings/
  <person-name>/
    facts.md          # Curated list of verified facts with sources (canonical reference)
    <topic>.md        # Deep-dive analysis on specific discoveries
```

## Guidelines

### facts.md Files
- **Purpose:** Authoritative reference of verified information
- **Content:** Only facts with sources - minimal interpretation
- **Format:** Organized by life stage (birth, childhood, education, etc.)
- **Sources:** Always cite sources for every fact
- **Updates:** Add new verified facts as research progresses
- **Uncertainties:** Clearly mark conflicts or unknowns (e.g., "Sept 9 vs Sept 15 - verify")

### Topic Files (e.g., 1940-census.md, military-service.md)
- **Purpose:** Detailed analysis of specific discoveries
- **Content:** Can include speculation, questions, and research notes
- **Format:** Free-form - whatever makes sense for the topic
- **Cross-reference:** Link to `facts.md` for canonical info

## Existing Directories

- `howard-higgins/` - Howard Robert Higgins/Birch (1927-2019)
- `doris-kuthe/` - Doris Kuthe Higgins Bynon (1902-1996)
- `robert-birch/` - Robert W. Birch (1869-1950)
- `james-higgins/` - James Everett Higgins (1892-1938)

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Biographies** (`research/reports/*_bio.md`) - Narrative storytelling for publication
- **Timeline Data** (`research/reports/timeline-data/*.yml`) - Structured data for bio pages
- **Analysis** (`research/analysis/`) - Cross-person research and synthesis
- **Findings** (here) - Person-specific factual discoveries

Think of it this way:
- **facts.md** = What we know for certain
- **Topic files** = How we discovered it and what it might mean
- **Biographies** = How we tell the story to others
