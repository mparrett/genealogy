## Critical Gaps in Knowledge

James Everett Higgins is the **most mysterious figure** in Howard's story:

- We know almost nothing about his background or family
- We don't know why the marriage ended
- We don't know if he knew about Howard's placement
- We don't know if he maintained any contact
- We don't know the circumstances of his death
- We have no documentation of his life between 1928-1938

**The death certificate is crucial** - it may be the only document that provides:
- His actual occupation in 1938
- His address (may lead to city directory listings)
- His marital status (remarried? Divorced? Widowed?)
- Next of kin (who was notified of his death?)

**Impact on Howard's Story:**

James's absence shapes everything:
- Howard grew up without a father
- The Birch family filled that role
- Howard took the Birch name, not Higgins
- James died when Howard was 10 (likely without Howard knowing)
- James never knew Howard became an engineer like him

## Speculation vs. Facts

**What We Know (Facts):**
- Born 1892
- Railroad civil engineer for Western Pacific
- Married Doris Kuthe, Nov 6, 1926, Tucson
- Son Howard born Sept 9, 1927
- Marriage ended ~1928
- Died July 6, 1938, San Francisco, age 46

**What We Don't Know (Need Evidence):**
- Everything else

**Avoid Assumptions:**
- Did he "abandon" them? (No evidence - could have been mutual decision, job relocation, etc.)
- Was he a "deadbeat dad"? (No evidence - may have sent money, may have died before he could reconnect)
- Did he know about the Birches? (Unknown)
- Did he object to Howard's placement? (Unknown)

**Let the documents speak** - until we find divorce records, death certificate, or other documentation, James's story remains largely unknown.
