## Connection to Agua Caliente (BEFORE Marriage)

**August 20, 1926:** Voter registration at **Agua Caliente, Maricopa, Arizona**
- **THREE MONTHS BEFORE** marrying James Higgins (Nov 6, 1926)
- This means Doris was **already part of the Birch household/community**
- Likely living/working at the resort
- Explains how she knew the Birches so well

**Source:** Arizona Voter Registrations, 1866-1955

**Implications:**
- Doris didn't meet the Birches through James
- She was already integrated into Agua Caliente community
- When she became pregnant, she had an existing support network
- The March 1927 photo with Governor Hunt makes perfect sense - she was part of the household

## Motherhood & Relationship with Howard

### Pregnancy & Birth

**Conception:** Late December 1926 (shortly after marriage)
**March 20, 1927:** Photographed at Agua Caliente with Governor Hunt (3 months pregnant)
- Standing with Mary Birch, A.L. Mortenson, L.W. Martin, Governor Hunt
- At King Woolsey ruins
- James not present (already in California)
**Source:** Arizona Memory Project #218999

**Birth:**
- **Date:** September 15, 1927
- **Place:** Tucson, Pima County, Arizona
- **Doris's residence:** Tucson
- **Doris's occupation:** Housewife - Teacher
- **James's residence:** San Francisco, California (separated geographically)
- **Original name on birth certificate:** James Everett Higgins (named after father)
- **Amended to:** Howard Robert Higgins
- **Amendment signed by:** Doris K. Bynon (after her 1933 marriage to Bynon)
**Source:** Arizona Birth Certificate #882-915-4725; Amendment record

### August 1928 - Crisis Month

**Aug 29, 1928:** Multiple newspaper mentions:
- "Wallace Kuthe critically ill" (brother in Tucson)
- "Doris Huggins will leave" (Tucson)
- Residence: 337 North 6th Ave, Tucson (lived with sister Jessie)
**Source:** Arizona Daily Star, Aug 29, 1928

**Context:** This was around when Howard (age ~1) was placed with the Birches. Brother Wallace died 3 months later (Nov 1928).

### Placement with Birches

**Timeframe:** Late 1928
**Howard's Age:** Approximately 14-15 months old
**Living Situation:** Howard went to Robert & Sarah Birch at Agua Caliente

**1928 Residence for Doris:** "Caliente Springs, AZ" listed in city directory
- Suggests she may have been at/near Agua Caliente in 1928
- Possibly living there while figuring out arrangements

### CRITICAL: Doris MAINTAINED CONTACT with Howard

**September 26, 1929:** "Doris Higgins visits Agua Caliente - Doris spent Sunday with Burch family"
- Howard was 2 years old
- Doris was divorced but visiting regularly
**Source:** Arizona Republic, Sept 26, 1929

**April 7, 1933:** "**Doris travels to Agua Caliente to visit her small son Howard**"
- Howard was 5 years old
- Doris was teaching in Vekol Valley (Casa Grande area)
- She was about to marry Henry Bynon (6 months later)
- Explicitly states she was visiting "her small son Howard"
**Source:** Casa Grande Dispatch, April 7, 1933

**This DESTROYS the abandonment narrative.** Doris:
- Visited Howard regularly (documented 1929, 1933, likely more)
- The relationship was acknowledged ("her small son")
- She maintained connection while building new life

### Family Care Network: Sister Jessie's Role

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Howard's care involved **biological family**, not just the Birches.

**Sister Jessie Velma Kuthe Rosser:**
- Doris's younger sister (born 1905, 3 years younger than Doris)
- 1920: Established in Silver City, New Mexico (working as stenographer, age 15)
- 1922: Married Willis A. Rosser Sr.
- 1923: Son Willis A. Rosser Jr. born (Howard's cousin, 4 years older than Howard)

**Anecdotal Evidence:**
- Howard and cousin Willis A. Rosser Jr. were together in New Mexico at some point
- Dates unknown (~1930s?)
- Suggests Jessie participated in Howard's care alongside the Birches

**Care Network Pattern:**
This reveals a **flexible family/community care network**:
1. **Primary:** Robert & Sarah Birch at Agua Caliente (1928-1935+)
2. **Secondary:** Sister Jessie Kuthe Rosser & nephew Willis in New Mexico (period unknown)
3. **Tertiary:** Woodard family in Phoenix (1940 census, Howard age 12)
4. **Throughout:** Doris visiting and maintaining contact

**Significance:**
- Doris didn't "give up" Howard to strangers
- She arranged care within her trusted friend network (Birches) AND biological family (sister Jessie)
- Howard had connection to both Birch family and Kuthe biological family
- Nephew Willis (4 years older) may have been like brother figure to Howard
- This was community-based care, not institutional placement

**Open Questions:**
- When exactly were Howard and Willis in New Mexico?
- How long did Howard stay with Jessie?
- Did Howard know Jessie was his biological aunt?
- Did Willis know Howard was his cousin?
- Was the Woodard placement connected to the Rosser/Kuthe network?

**Sources:** Anecdotal family evidence; 1920 U.S. Census (Jessie in Silver City, NM)

## Reframing the Narrative

**Old assumption:** Young mother abandoned baby in crisis

**Reality revealed by documents:**

Doris Pauline Kuthe was a **resilient, accomplished woman** who:

1. **Lost her mother at age 4** and grew up in a reconstituted family
2. **Pursued education** despite family tragedies
3. **Built a teaching career** that spanned decades
4. **Was already part of the Agua Caliente community** when she married James
5. **Made a thoughtful decision** when her marriage failed and she was a single working mother
6. **Placed Howard with trusted friends** (the Birches) who could provide stability
7. **Maintained contact** with Howard throughout his childhood (documented visits)
8. **Kept lifelong friendship** with Sarah Birch (26+ years of documented connection)
9. **Rose to Supervisor** of elementary schools despite personal hardships
10. **Lived to age 93** with dignity

This is not a story of abandonment. This is a story of **community care, resilient motherhood, and maintained relationships** in the face of economic hardship and social constraints.

The March 1927 photo of Doris with Governor Hunt, the 1929 and 1933 documented visits, and the 1953 witness signature all prove: **Doris never disappeared from Howard's or the Birch family's life.**
