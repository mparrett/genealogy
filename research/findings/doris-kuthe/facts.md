## Critical Discovery: The 1927 Photo

The March 20, 1927 photograph fundamentally changed our understanding of Doris's story:

**Old Assumption:** Doris was a struggling young mother who gave up her baby in crisis

**New Reality:**
- Doris was embedded in the Birch family's social circle DURING her pregnancy
- She was present at gubernatorial visits to Agua Caliente
- She was significant enough to be included in official photographs
- The placement of Howard with the Birches was likely NOT a crisis handoff to strangers
- This was more likely a planned arrangement with trusted friends

This reframes the narrative from **abandonment** to **community care arrangement**.
