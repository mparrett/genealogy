## Uncertain / Needs Verification

### Possible First Marriage - 1921

**Record:** Arizona County Marriage Records
- Name: Anna Gleason (spelling differs from "Gleeson")
- Spouse: Paul B. Hannah
- Date: June 1, 1921
- Place: Maricopa County, Arizona

**Status:** UNCERTAIN - Could be Anne Barbara Gleeson with a first husband, or a different Anna Gleason. The name spelling differs, but she did go by "Anna" and Arizona records may have misspelled her surname. Further research needed on Paul B. Hannah and whether this marriage ended in divorce or death.
