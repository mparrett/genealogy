## Extended Family Care Network

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Howard's care involved a network of biological family members, not just the Birches.

**Maternal Aunt:** Jessie Velma Kuthe (1905-1993)
- Doris's younger sister (born 3 years after Doris)
- 1920: Age 15, working as stenographer in **Silver City, New Mexico**
- Married: Willis A. Rosser Sr.
- Son: **Willis A. Rosser Jr.** (born 1923)
- Established in New Mexico by 1920

**Cousin:** Willis A. Rosser Jr. (born 1923)
- Howard's first cousin (Jessie's son)
- 4 years older than Howard
- **Anecdotal evidence:** Went with Howard to New Mexico at some point
- They were together in New Mexico for a period (dates unclear)

**Care Network Pattern:**
This reveals Howard's childhood involved a **flexible family/community care network**:
1. **Primary:** Robert & Sarah Birch at Agua Caliente (1928-1935+)
2. **Secondary:** Aunt Jessie Kuthe Rosser & cousin Willis in New Mexico (period unknown, ~1930s?)
3. **Tertiary:** Woodard family in Phoenix (1940 census, age 12)
4. **Throughout:** Doris visiting and maintaining contact

**Implications:**
- Howard was cared for within his biological mother's family network
- Not "abandoned to strangers" but placed with mother's trusted friends AND family
- Cousin Willis (4 years older) may have been like an older brother figure
- New Mexico connection through Aunt Jessie (established there since 1920)
- The Woodard arrangement (1940) may connect to the Rosser/Kuthe network

**Open Questions:**
- When exactly were Howard and Willis in New Mexico?
- Was this between 1935-1940? Earlier?
- Were they with Jessie and Willis Sr. in Silver City?
- How long did they stay?
- Did Howard know Willis was his biological cousin?
- Did Jessie move back to Arizona by 1940?
- How did the Woodards connect to this network?

**Sources:** Anecdotal family evidence; 1920 U.S. Census (Jessie in Silver City, NM); birth records (Willis Jr. born 1923)

- **1940 Census shows Robert & Sarah Birch were still at Agua Caliente** (Robert age 71, working 84 hrs/week)
- Resort still operating with 19+ lodgers
- Possible reasons:
  - Educational opportunity in Phoenix (North High School)
