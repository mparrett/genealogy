## Open Questions

1. **Patrick Gleason connection** — Is he definitively James J.'s father? Limited documentation.
2. **Australia connection** — Why did Margaritte Malony die in Australia? Did other Gleesons emigrate there?
3. **James J.'s return to Ireland (1908–1909)** — Purpose of trip? Family visit?
4. **Maria Ann's 1884 NYC residence** — Was the family moving back and forth?
5. **Harold Francis Gleason born Chicago (1903)** — Why Chicago? Family temporarily there?
6. **William (James) Fitzgerald** — Why the dual first name? Was he "William" or "James"?
