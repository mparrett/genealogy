# Deep Research: Gleeson/Fitzgerald Line (Web Sources Only)

I'm researching the Gleeson and Fitzgerald families who settled in Wisconsin. I need help filling in gaps and resolving some confusing overlaps. Web-accessible sources only — FamilySearch, Ancestry previews, newspapers, Find a Grave, WikiTree, Geni, etc.

## What I know (confirmed)

- **James J. Gleeson** (21 Dec 1864 – 28 Jan 1946): Born Ireland. Parents: Patrick Gleeson + Margaret Moloney. Immigrated c. 1883 (arrived New York from Liverpool/Queenstown). Married Maria Ann Fitzgerald 23 Nov 1892 in Mondovi, Buffalo County, WI. Died Waite Park, Stearns County, Minnesota.
- **Maria Ann Fitzgerald** (3 Jul 1865 – 1916): Born Ironton, Sauk County, Wisconsin. US-born to Irish immigrant parents (names unknown). Married James 1892.
- **Anne B. Gleeson** (17 Aug 1903 – Jan 1986): Born Mondovi, WI. Married Raymond Mowrey 1930 in Arizona. Died Tucson.

## Priority 1: Maria's parents (the unknown Irish ancestors)

Search for Maria Fitzgerald as a child in:
- **1870 US Census, Sauk County, Wisconsin** — Maria would be ~5. Look for Fitzgerald household in/near Ironton.
- **1880 US Census, Sauk County, Wisconsin** — Maria would be ~15.

I need:
- Parents' names
- Parents' birthplaces (Ireland — which county?)
- Any siblings
- Father's occupation

This is the key to unlocking the Fitzgerald Irish ancestry.

## Priority 2: Maria's death (1916)

- **Wisconsin death records** (if she died there)
- **Minnesota death records** (if she followed James there)
- **Find a Grave** search for Maria Gleeson / Maria Fitzgerald in WI or MN

Death certificates often include:
- Parents' names (backup source for Priority 1)
- Cause of death
- Informant (often a family member)

## Priority 3: James's naturalization records

Search for James Gleeson naturalization in:
- **Wisconsin** (Buffalo County, where they lived)
- **Minnesota** (Stearns County, where he died)

Naturalization records sometimes include:
- Specific birthplace in Ireland (county, parish, townland)
- Date and port of arrival
- Witnesses (often relatives or fellow immigrants)

## Priority 4: James & Maria's children

Census records show they had multiple children. Please compile a list from 1900, 1910, 1920 census records:
- Names, birth years, birth places
- Which ones survived to adulthood
- Any marriages or death records for the children

From my existing notes I see references to: James Jr., Jennie, John, Joseph, Margaret, Annie (Anne). Need to confirm and organize.

## Priority 5: Patrick Gleeson disambiguation (IMPORTANT)

**The problem:** James's father is listed as Patrick Gleeson. However, there's confusion in the research about Patrick's immigration path. One fellow researcher believes it was a straightforward Ireland → Minnesota/Wisconsin route. But there are overlapping records that suggest a possible Australia or England connection — possibly a different Patrick Gleeson with similar dates getting tangled up.

**What I need:**
- Any records for Patrick Gleeson (father of James J. Gleeson, husband of Margaret Moloney) that clarify his immigration path
- Are there multiple Patrick Gleesons in the MN/WI area in the 1880s-1900s with Irish origins?
- Any Australian or English passenger records for a Patrick Gleeson that might be getting confused with our Patrick?
- Death record for Patrick Gleeson in MN/WI that might confirm birthplace

**Disambiguation clues:**
- Our Patrick should be connected to Margaret Moloney (wife) and James J. Gleeson (son born 1864 Ireland)
- If Patrick came via Australia/England, there might be a different arrival date or port
- Check for multiple Patrick Gleeson + Margaret combinations

## Priority 6: Irish origins — county/parish

If any records give a more specific Irish origin than just "Ireland," note them:
- County (Tipperary is common for Gleeson surname)
- Parish or townland
- Any references to specific places in naturalization, obituaries, or church records

## Constraints

- **Web-only research** — no phone calls, no in-person archive visits
- Free sources preferred; Ancestry previews fine for confirming record existence
- I can access FamilySearch (free account)
- Focus on disambiguation — help me untangle overlapping Patrick Gleeson records

## Format

For each priority, give me:
1. What you found (with source)
2. Confidence level (confirmed vs. probable vs. uncertain)
3. Any conflicts or ambiguities that need resolving
4. Recommended next steps

Be explicit about when records might be referring to different people with similar names.
