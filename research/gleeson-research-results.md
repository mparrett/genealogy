## PRIMARY SOURCE: Marriage Record (Buffalo County, WI, 1892)

**Source:** Wisconsin, U.S., County Marriage Records, 1838-1911 via Ancestry
**Record:** Registration of Marriage No. 126 / 00799
**Link:** https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/61484/records/1691820

### Transcription

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full name of husband | James Gleason |
| Father of husband | Patrick Gleason |
| Mother of husband (maiden) | **Margarette Malony** |
| Occupation of husband | Mill hand |
| Residence of husband | Eau Claire, WI |
| Birthplace of husband | Ireland |
| Full name of wife | Maria Fitzgerald |
| Father of wife | James Fitzgerald |
| Mother of wife (maiden) | **Maria Fitzgerald** |
| Birthplace of wife | Wisconsin |
| Marriage date | Nov. 23, 1892 |
| Marriage place | Mondovi, Buffalo Co., WI |
| Ceremony | Catholic |
| Officiant | Joseph M. Baur, Catholic Priest (Durand, Pepin Co., WI) |
| Witnesses | William Fitzgerald, Mary O. Guffin (or Griffin) |
| Date of registration | Nov. 29, 1892 |

### What This Confirms

1. **James's parents**: Patrick Gleason + Margarette Malony (Margaret Moloney) — matches Croom baptism record
2. **Maria's father**: James Fitzgerald — confirmed
3. **Maria's mother**: Listed as "Maria Fitzgerald" — same surname as father (see note below)
4. **James's occupation**: Mill hand in Eau Claire at time of marriage
5. **Witness William Fitzgerald**: Likely Maria's brother or close relative

### Research Note: Maria's Mother — RESOLVED

The marriage record lists Maria's mother as "Maria Fitzgerald" (same surname as father). This was a **clerical error**.

**Resolution:** A baptism record confirms the mother's identity:

| Field | Baptism Record (FHL 1316579) |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Child | Mary Fitzgerald |
| Birth date | 3 Jul 1865 |
| Baptism date | 4 Sep 1865 |
| Baptism place | Notre Dame, Chippewa Falls, Chippewa, WI |
| Father | James Fitzgerald |
| Mother | **Mary Finey** (also transcribed "Mary Finny") |

"Mary Finey/Finny" = **Mary Feeney** — matches Geni's "Mary Ann Feeney"

The 1892 marriage record clerk likely repeated "Fitzgerald" by mistake when recording the mother's maiden name.

### Research Note: Birth Location Discrepancy

- **Baptism record**: Chippewa Falls, Chippewa County, WI
- **Find a Grave / trees**: Ironton, Sauk County, WI

These locations are ~150 miles apart. Possible explanations:
- Fitzgerald family was in Chippewa Falls area in 1865, later moved to Sauk/Buffalo counties
- Ironton birthplace is an error carried forward in family trees
- Chippewa Falls (Notre Dame church) was the nearest Catholic parish for baptism

**Still needed:** Maria's 1916 Wisconsin death certificate to definitively confirm parents' names and resolve location question.

## PRIMARY SOURCE: Find a Grave — Maria Ann Gleeson

**Source:** Find a Grave (via Ancestry index)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Maria Ann Gleeson (née Fitzgerald) |
| Birth | 3 Jul 1865, Ironton, Sauk County, WI (but see baptism note above) |
| Death | 1916, Mondovi, Buffalo County, WI |

## James J. Gleeson (1863–1946)

**Note:** FamilySearch index for the parish register lists Jacobus Gleeson baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick (parents Patritii Gleeson + Margaritæ Moloney; image unavailable, may need NLI parish register images). Obituary rounded birth year to 1864.

### What I found (with source)

* FamilySearch (profile summary):

  * Born: 21 Dec 1864, Ireland (per FamilySearch; parish register shows baptism 23 Dec 1863, Croom, Limerick)
  * Parents: Patrick Gleeson + Margaret Moloney
  * Married: Maria Ann Fitzgerald on 23 Nov 1892
  * Associated place shown: Mondovi, Buffalo, Wisconsin, USA
  * Death reference shown: “James J Gluson, Minnesota Deaths, 1887–2001”
* FamilySearch parish register index (image unavailable):

  * Name: Jacobus Gleeson
  * Father's name: Patritii Gleeson
  * Mother's name: Margaritæ Moloney
  * Event: Baptism
  * Event date: 23 Dec 1863
  * Event place: Croom, County Limerick, Ireland
  * Record link: `https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XM43-88KX?lang=en`

* WikiTree index / snippets (not fully accessible to open, but snippet shows key facts):

  * Birth in Ireland, death 28 Jan 1946, Waite Park, Stearns County, Minnesota

### What it tells us about Ireland → US → Arizona

* James himself appears to be Ireland-born (not US-born), and he’s tied to Buffalo County, Wisconsin by the early 1900s (Mondovi).
* He likely did not die in Arizona — the strongest public trail points to Minnesota (1946).
* The Arizona connection may be through his daughter Anne, rather than James relocating there.

### Leads worth pursuing next

* 1900 + 1910 US Census for James in/near Buffalo County, WI: these often list immigration year and naturalization status (a fast way to pin down the Ireland→US timing).
* If FamilySearch is correct about a Minnesota death record, that entry (or a linked certificate) may include birthplace detail beyond “Ireland” and/or parents again.

## Maria Ann Fitzgerald (1865–1916)

### What I found (with source)

* Geni summary page (public snippet):

  * Born: 3 Jul 1865, Ironton, Sauk County, Wisconsin
  * Also known as: Maria Ann Gleeson
  * Died: 1916 (place not shown in snippet)
* FamilySearch summary (spouse linkage):

  * Married to James Joseph Gleeson; marriage 23 Nov 1892

### What it tells us about Ireland → US → Arizona

* Maria looks US-born (Wisconsin), which shifts the “Ireland origin” question to her parents (likely Irish immigrants or 1st-gen Irish-American in Wisconsin).
* She died in 1916, so she may never have made it to Arizona if the move happened later (Anne’s Arizona marriage is 1930).

### Leads worth pursuing next

* 1870/1880 census in Sauk County, WI for Maria as a child → usually the quickest way to identify:

  * parents’ names
  * whether parents were Ireland-born
* Wisconsin death record (1916): often contains parents’ names (varies by informant quality).

## Anne B. (Barbara) Gleeson (1903–1986)

### What I found (with source)

* WikiTree snippet:

  * Born: about 17 Aug 1903, Mondovi, Buffalo County, Wisconsin
  * Died: Jan 1986, Tucson, Pima County, Arizona
  * Married: 1930 in Arizona to Robert Raymond Mowrey

### What it tells us about Ireland → US → Arizona

* This gives you a clean “bridge” point:

  * By 1903, the family is in Mondovi, Wisconsin.
  * By 1930, Anne is in Arizona (married there).
  * By 1986, she’s firmly established in Tucson.
* So the likely macro-path is:

* Ireland (James) → Wisconsin (family base by 1903) → Arizona (Anne by 1930) → Tucson (later life).

### Leads worth pursuing next

* Arizona marriage record (1930) for Anne + Raymond:

  * This is often the best single document to prove where Anne was living immediately before Arizona, and sometimes names witnesses/family.
* 1910 + 1920 census with James/Maria/Anne in Wisconsin (should be straightforward once you locate one household).

## General / “first landing point” and Arizona context

### Wisconsin clustering (likely your “first US anchor”)

Based on the public snippets you’ve got:

* Mondovi, Buffalo County, WI (Anne born there; James & Maria associated there)
* Ironton, Sauk County, WI (Maria born there)

That strongly suggests your Gleeson–Fitzgerald story starts in Wisconsin, not Arizona.

### Arizona “Gleeson” territorial-era records (context, may or may not be your line)

There is a Gleeson, Arizona ghost town (Cochise County), founded as a mining camp and named for John Gleeson.

Arizona Memory Project materials also contain many historic directory / business references to “Gleeson” as a place name.

This may be unrelated to your family, but it’s worth knowing because it can create false hits when searching newspapers and directories.

### Irish origin patterns (surname-level, not person-specific)

* Gleeson is commonly associated with Tipperary (and nearby areas) in Irish surname geography; there are modern Gleeson genealogy projects that focus heavily on that region.
* Fitzgerald is widespread across Ireland, with strong historic concentrations in the south/southwest (often harder to narrow without parent names + a specific parish/townland).

## Practical “next 5 searches” (highest yield)

1. 1900 Census: “James Gleeson” in/near Buffalo County, Wisconsin (look for immigration year).
2. 1910 Census: same household (often repeats immigration + naturalization).
3. Maria Fitzgerald parents in 1870/1880 Sauk County, Wisconsin.
4. 1930 Arizona marriage record: Anne Gleeson ↔ Raymond Mowrey (county + certificate).
5. James Minnesota death record detail (Stearns County / Waite Park) to confirm identity + birthplace detail.

⠀
If you want, I can do a second pass that focuses only on: (a) pulling the most likely census hits for 1900/1910/1920 and (b) locking down the 1930 Arizona marriage record trail using free indexes/newspaper mentions.
