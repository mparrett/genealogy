| **Lewis R. Mowery** | Death year | 1859 | c. 1850 | *Biographical Souvenir* (1889): "died in 1850" |
| **Lewis R. Mowery** | Birthplace | Germany (if set) | Knox County, Tennessee | Father's will proved Knox Co 1840; deep research |
| **Lewis R. Mowery** | Parents | (none?) | Peter W. Mowrey (1760–1840) + Sophia Clapp (1768–1829) | Knox Co will; J. Six genealogy (2002) |
| **Elizabeth Lisbee** | Death location | (blank?) | Lamar County, Texas | *Biographical Souvenir*: Pleasant "reached Texas the year of his mother's death" |
| **Elizabeth Lisbee** | Parents | (none?) | Moses Lisbee + Lucy [?] | J. Six genealogy (2002) |
| **Elizabeth Lisbee** | Birth year | 1806 | Keep 1806 (uncertain) | *Biographical Souvenir* says 1815 but that's impossible (married 1819). 1806 is more plausible. |
| **Margaret E. Witt** | Death year | 1904 | c. 1900–1903 | Alive in 1900 census; Moses was widower by 1904 death. WikiTree gives ~1900. |
| **Samuel S. Mowrey** | Middle initial | S | Keep S (confirmed) | 1889 *Biographical Souvenir* and 1897 marriage record ("S. S. Mower") |

## Additions

- **Peter W. Mowrey** (Johann Peter Maurer) — born 1760, died 1840 Knox County, TN. Lewis's father. Pennsylvania German from Rhineland stock.
- **Sophia Clapp** — born 1768, died 1829. Lewis's mother.
- **Moses Lisbee** — Knox County, TN. Elizabeth's father. Dates unknown.
- **Lucy [?]** — Elizabeth's mother. Nothing else known.

## Profile Notes to Add

- **Lewis:** Remove "German immigrant" — he was American-born. The German heritage traces to his father Peter (PA German) or earlier ancestors.
- **Moses:** Add "Postmaster of Milton, TX, 1870s"
- **Moses + Samuel:** Add note "Both died 29 August 1904 in Lamar County, TX. Cause unknown."

## Key Narrative Change

The biggest fix is Lewis's death year (1859 → 1850). Lewis and Elizabeth did NOT die together — he died nearly a decade before her. Elizabeth survived as a widow, eventually moved to Texas to join her children, and died there in 1859.

## Kuthe Line Corrections (Jan 2025)

Based on ChatGPT deep research using ship manifests, census records, and county histories.

### Corrections

| Person | Field | Currently shows | Should be | Source |
|--------|-------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Frederick Kuthe** | Birthplace | Darmstadt, Hesse | Vöhl, Waldeck region of Hesse | 1845 *Olbers* passenger manifest (ISTG) |
| **Frederick Kuthe** | Birth year | (varies) | c. 1822–1827 | Ship manifest (age 18 in 1845) |
| **Frederick Kuthe** | Immigration | (blank?) | June 1845, ship *Olbers* (Bremen → New Orleans) | ISTG manifest; Schleicher biography |
| **Frederick Kuthe** | Death | (blank?) | Feb 10, 1900, Dent County, MO | Local records; absent from 1900 census |
| **Sarah Ann Steagall** | Married name at wedding | Sarah Ann Steagall | Sarah Ann Patterson (née Steagall) | Dent Co marriage register: "Sarah A. Patterson" |
| **Sarah Ann Steagall** | Death year | (blank?) | 1876 | Frederick widower in 1880 census |
| **George W. Kuthe** | Mother's death | (blank?) | 1876 (age 7 when orphaned) | 1880 census shows Frederick as widower |

### Additions

- **Andreas Kuthe** — Frederick's father (family tradition). Born c. 1798 in Hesse. No primary source.
- **Mary C. Kuthe** — Frederick's sister. Born 1824 Germany, immigrated 1845. Married Louis Schleicher in Lancaster, Ohio (April 1847).
- **William Kuthe** — George's brother. Born c. 1868–1870.
- **Mary Kuthe** — George's sister. Married Louis Schmit. Remained in Missouri.
- **Catherine Kuthe** — George's sister. Born c. 1873.
- **Susan Kuthe** — George's sister. Born mid-1870s.
- **Adam Kuthe** — George's youngest brother. Born c. 1875–1876. Married "Sally" (surname unknown).

### Profile Notes to Add

- **Frederick:** Full name may be "George Frederick Kuthe" (per marriage register). Surname variants in records: Kuethe, Küthe, Kuth, Kuthy, Koothe, "Kite"
- **Frederick:** Initially settled in Palmyra, Marion County, MO before moving to Dent County (organized 1851)
- **George:** Add siblings; note mother died when he was 7

### Key Narrative Change

Sarah Ann Steagall was a **widow** (previously married to a Patterson) when she married Frederick in 1868. She died in 1876, leaving Frederick to raise six children alone. The "Sarah Ann Kuthe marrying Patterson in 1867" record was misread—she was Patterson's widow marrying Kuthe, not vice versa.

### Possible Relatives (Not Our Line)

**George E. Kethe Sr.** (28 Apr 1822 – 10 Feb 1909) of Schuyler County, MO — [Find a Grave #45551447](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/45551447/george_e-kethe). Born in Germany, buried Germania Cemetery, Schuyler County. Spouse: Elizabeth C. "Eliza" Weitzel Kethe (1825–1901). Children: Margaret, George Jr., Henry, Mary Elizabeth.

**Assessment:** Confirmed DIFFERENT family from our Frederick Kuthe. Different wife (Weitzel vs Steagall), different county (Schuyler vs Dent), different death year (1909 vs 1900). Similar German origin and 1840s immigration timing suggests possible distant relation, but not our direct line.

### Kuthe References

- **ISTG ship manifest, *Olbers*** — Bremen to New Orleans, 13 June 1845. Küthe family from Vöhl including Friederich (18), Maria (20).

### Patrick Gleeson Disambiguation (IMPORTANT)

**The confusion:** Some trees show Patrick Gleeson (James's father) immigrating to MN/WI, or via Australia/England. This is INCORRECT.

**What we found:**
- Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney (James's parents) **never came to the US**
- They remained in Ireland; James emigrated alone c. 1883
- No U.S. census or immigration records found for Patrick & Margaret together
- Confusion comes from:
  - **Different Patrick Gleeson (1837–1901)** in Minnesota, married to Mary (not Margaret)
  - **Ohio Patrick Gleeson** with a Margaret Moloney — but she was his mother, not wife (died 1904 age 75)
  - **Australian Patrick Gleesons** — completely unrelated

**Bottom line:** Any Patrick Gleeson found in MN/WI records is NOT James J. Gleeson's father.

### Profile Notes to Add

- **James J. Gleeson:** Immigration c. 1883 (arrived New York 29 Sep 1883 from Liverpool/Queenstown, age ~19). Settled in Wisconsin, NOT Arizona. Died in Minnesota. Parents stayed in Ireland.
- **Maria:** US-born, not Irish immigrant. Father from County Limerick.
- **Anne:** The one who moved to Arizona (c. 1930). Married Raymond Mowrey 1930 in Arizona.

### Key Narrative Change

The family path is **Ireland → Wisconsin → Arizona**, not "Ireland → Arizona":
- James immigrated from Ireland to Wisconsin (c. 1883); his parents stayed in Ireland
- Maria was born in Wisconsin to Irish immigrants from County Limerick
- Family was based in Mondovi, Buffalo County, WI through the 1900s–1920s
- James died in Minnesota (1946), never lived in Arizona
- Anne is the one who moved to Arizona as an adult (c. 1930)
