Based on deep research findings (Jan 2025).

## Corrections

| Person | Field | Currently shows | Should be | Source |
|--------|-------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Lewis R. Mowery** | Death year | 1859 | c. 1850 | *Biographical Souvenir* (1889): "died in 1850" |
| **Lewis R. Mowery** | Birthplace | Germany (if set) | Knox County, Tennessee | Father's will proved Knox Co 1840; deep research |
| **Lewis R. Mowery** | Parents | (none?) | Peter W. Mowrey (1760–1840) + Sophia Clapp (1768–1829) | Knox Co will; J. Six genealogy (2002) |
| **Elizabeth Lisbee** | Death location | (blank?) | Lamar County, Texas | *Biographical Souvenir*: Pleasant "reached Texas the year of his mother's death" |
| **Elizabeth Lisbee** | Parents | (none?) | Moses Lisbee + Lucy [?] | J. Six genealogy (2002) |
| **Elizabeth Lisbee** | Birth year | 1806 | Keep 1806 (uncertain) | *Biographical Souvenir* says 1815 but that's impossible (married 1819). 1806 is more plausible. |
| **Margaret E. Witt** | Death year | 1904 | c. 1900–1903 | Alive in 1900 census; Moses was widower by 1904 death. WikiTree gives ~1900. |
| **Samuel S. Mowrey** | Middle initial | S | Keep S (confirmed) | 1889 *Biographical Souvenir* and 1897 marriage record ("S. S. Mower") |

## Additions

- **Peter W. Mowrey** (Johann Peter Maurer) — born 1760, died 1840 Knox County, TN. Lewis's father. Pennsylvania German from Rhineland stock.
- **Sophia Clapp** — born 1768, died 1829. Lewis's mother.
- **Moses Lisbee** — Knox County, TN. Elizabeth's father. Dates unknown.
- **Lucy [?]** — Elizabeth's mother. Nothing else known.

## Profile Notes to Add

- **Lewis:** Remove "German immigrant" — he was American-born. The German heritage traces to his father Peter (PA German) or earlier ancestors.
- **Moses:** Add "Postmaster of Milton, TX, 1870s"
- **Moses + Samuel:** Add note "Both died 29 August 1904 in Lamar County, TX. Cause unknown."

## Key Narrative Change

The biggest fix is Lewis's death year (1859 → 1850). Lewis and Elizabeth did NOT die together — he died nearly a decade before her. Elizabeth survived as a widow, eventually moved to Texas to join her children, and died there in 1859.
