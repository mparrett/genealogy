# Research Task: Patrick Gleeson + Margaret Moloney Marriage Record

I'm looking for the marriage record of Patrick Gleeson and Margaret Moloney (also spelled Malony/Maloney) in Ireland, likely late 1850s to early 1862.

## What I know

- **Patrick Gleeson**: born ~1840, County Tipperary or Limerick area; occupation: Sailor; residence: "The Windmill", St Michael's District, Limerick City
- **Margaret Moloney**: born ~1843 (Latin form: Margaritæ Moloney)
- Their son James (Jacobus) was baptized 23 Dec 1863 in Croom, County Limerick
- Their son John was born 17 May 1864 in Limerick City ([civil record 2332267](https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1864/03611/2332267.pdf))

## Sources to check

- Irish Catholic parish marriage registers for Limerick City (especially St Michael's), Croom, and surrounding parishes
- NLI microfilm / IrishGenealogy.ie / FamilySearch
- Limerick and Tipperary border parishes

## Desired output

- Marriage date and parish
- Any additional details (witnesses, townlands, parents' names)
