# Higgins/Knight Line Research — First Pass (Web Search)

I'm researching the Higgins and Knight families. This line connects to the Kuthe family through marriage (James E. Higgins married Doris Kuthe in 1926). I need help filling in their story. Web-accessible sources only.

## What I know

### Laurence Higgins (1854–1940)
- 2nd great-grandfather
- Birth: 1854 (likely Ireland?)
- Death: 1940
- Married Mary Knight
- Father of James E. Higgins

### Mary Knight (1866–1930)
- 2nd great-grandmother
- Birth: c. 1865–1866, Ireland
- Death: 27 Mar 1930, New York (died in almshouse, admitted 17 Feb 1930 as widowed)
- Parents: **James Knight** + **Bridget Larney** (from Ancestry record)
- Married Laurence Higgins

### James E. Higgins (1892–1938)
- Great-grandfather
- Birth: 1892
- Death: 1938
- Married **Doris P. Kuthe** on 6 Nov 1926 in Phoenix, Arizona
- Father of Howard R. Higgins Birch (1922–2019)

## What I need to find

### Laurence Higgins
- Where and when was he born? Ireland?
- When did he immigrate?
- Parents' names?
- Where did he and Mary live? (Census records 1880–1920)
- When and where did he die (1940)?
- Any naturalization records?

### Mary Knight
- Confirm birthplace in Ireland — what county/parish?
- When did she immigrate?
- Where did she and Laurence marry? When?
- Why was she in a New York almshouse in 1930 (listed as widowed — but Laurence died 1940)?
- Were they separated/divorced? Or is Laurence's death date wrong?

### James Knight & Bridget Larney (Mary's parents)
- Any records for these parents?
- Immigration records?
- Other children (Mary's siblings)?

### James E. Higgins
- Where was he born?
- Census records showing him with parents
- How did he end up in Arizona by 1926?
- Death record (1938) — where, cause?
- What does the "E" stand for?

### Howard R. Higgins Birch connection
- Why does Howard have both "Higgins" and "Birch" as surnames?
- Was he adopted? Did his mother remarry?

## General questions
- Where did this family live? (New York? Elsewhere before Arizona?)
- Irish origins — what county for Higgins and Knight?
- How did James E. end up in Phoenix where he married Doris Kuthe?
