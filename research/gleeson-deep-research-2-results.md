I’ll pull up the research results and then summarize the key findings by your priority list, flagging conflicts and giving concrete next steps.


([Past chat][1])([Past chat][2])([Past chat][2])([Past chat][2])([Past chat][2])

Results were **mixed**: I found a couple of strong, directly relevant clues, but several of the best sources for your specific questions (FamilySearch record pages, key Find a Grave pages, and one newspaper item) were **not reachable from my web tool** (timeouts/blocks), so I couldn’t fully verify census/death/naturalization images end-to-end.

Below is what I *could* verify online, plus the most efficient next steps (still web-only) to close each priority.

---

## Priority 1: Maria’s parents (conflicting parentage)

### What I found

* A **Geni** profile asserts Maria Ann Fitzgerald (1865–1916) is the **daughter of James Fitzgerald and Mary Ann Feeney**. This is **not** reliable on its own (user-contributed, often unsourced). ([Geni][3])

### Confidence

* **Uncertain** (Geni alone is not enough).

### Conflicts / ambiguities

* This directly conflicts with your other tree variants (James + Margaret Murtagh/Murlagh vs William/James + Mary Ann Feeney).
* “James Fitzgerald” is a common name; you’ll want *one* record that ties **Maria (as a child)** to specific parents (1870/1880 census) or a **death certificate** naming parents.

### Recommended next steps (web-only, highest yield)

1. **1870 census (Sauk County) search strategy (Ancestry or FamilySearch):**

   * Search for **Maria/Mary Fitzgerald**, born **~1865**, state **Wisconsin**, county **Sauk**.
   * Use wildcards: `Fitzg*` and first name `Mar*`.
   * Try township keywords: **Ironton** and **Sumpter** (Ironton is associated with Sumpter in local history).
2. **1880 census (Sauk County):**

   * Repeat with age ~15.
   * Add Ireland-born parents filter if the results are too wide.
3. If census is stubborn: search **by siblings** once you identify any Fitzgerald household near Ironton.

## Priority 2: Maria’s death (1916)

### What I found

* A Find a Grave memorial for Maria’s daughter **Margaret M. (Gleeson) Theisen (1901–1980)** explicitly states she was born in Mondovi to “the late **James and Maria (Fitzgerald) Gleeson**.” This supports Maria’s maiden name and the family unit, but **does not name Maria’s parents**. ([Find a Grave][4])

### Confidence

* **Confirmed** for “Maria (Fitzgerald) Gleeson” as mother of Margaret (because it’s stated in a memorial/obituary-style entry).
* **Does not resolve** Maria’s parentage.

### Recommended next steps (web-only)

* Pull Maria’s **Wisconsin death certificate** (1916) via:

  * **FamilySearch**: “Wisconsin Death Certificates, 1907–2002” (image access often requires login; it’s still free).
  * Or **Wisconsin Vital Records / index sites** if a free index exists for 1916 and links to an image.
* On the death certificate, focus on:

  * Parents’ names (often the most direct resolution)
  * Informant (who supplied the parent names)

## Priority 3: James’s naturalization (WI/MN)

### What I found

* I did **not** reach a primary naturalization record in the time available due to source access limitations.

### Confidence

* **No finding yet**.

### Recommended next steps (web-only)

1. Search county-level naturalizations:

   * **Buffalo County, WI** (likely court naturalizations)
   * **Stearns County, MN** (if he naturalized later or re-filed)
2. Use **Ancestry** (even without world) and also **FamilySearch Catalog** for:

   * “Naturalization records” + county + time range.
3. If you find a declaration/petition:

   * Extract **exact birthplace**, **arrival date/ship**, and **witnesses** (often friends/relatives).

---

## Priority 4: James & Maria’s children (from census trail)

### What I found

* Your working list (James Jr., Jennie/Jane, John, Joseph, Margaret, Annie/Anne) is consistent with the kind of household expansion seen across 1900–1910.
* A 1940 Mondovi census name-index page lists **Gleeson, John (born ~1899)** in Mondovi, suggesting at least one son remained/returned there. ([LDS Genealogy][5])
* The Find a Grave memorial confirms **Margaret M. Gleeson** (born 1901) and ties her to James & Maria. ([Find a Grave][4])

### Confidence

* **Probable** for the child list (based on your notes) but needs direct census-image confirmation.
* **Confirmed** for Margaret as a child of James & Maria. ([Find a Grave][4])

### Recommended next steps (web-only)

* For each census year (1900/1910/1920), pull the **image** and record:

  * names as written
  * exact ages/month-year (1900 often gives birth month/year)
  * birthplace of each child + parents’ birthplaces
* Then build a single child table and attach:

  * marriage record
  * death record
  * burial (Find a Grave) where available

## Priority 5: Gleeson siblings in Croom (Margaret/Margarita; Jane/Janeta)

### What I found

* I was not able to open the specific FamilySearch record pages you linked (tool timeouts), so I couldn’t verify the indexed details directly from the web tool.

### Confidence

* **Not verified from sources I can access right now**.

### Recommended next steps (web-only)

* If you can open the FamilySearch pages directly:

  1. Confirm **same parents** across Margaret/Margarita entries and check for:

     * matching townland
     * matching sponsor/godparent names (helpful to confirm same family)
  2. For Jane/Janeta, compare:

     * civil registration (birth) vs baptism date
  3. Then search for those siblings in:

     * Ireland civil marriage/death indexes
     * emigration/passenger lists (US/Australia)

---

## Priority 6: Patrick Gleeson disambiguation (and Australia/England confusion)

### What I found

* No direct Patrick Gleeson (James’s father) record was reachable in the time window.

### Confidence

* **No finding yet**.

### Recommended next steps (web-only, disambiguation approach)

* Treat this as a **cluster identity problem**:

  1. Anchor records that mention **Patrick + Margaret Moloney** together (Ireland baptisms are best).
  2. Separately, collect every Patrick Gleeson in WI/MN with:

     * spouse name
     * children
     * residence timeline
  3. Only then compare to Australia/England “Patrick Gleeson + Margaret/Maloney” candidates.
* The key is: **don’t merge** across countries unless you have a linking record (passenger list with matching spouse/child, or a death record naming spouse/child).

---

## Priority 7: Irish origins (townland/parish specificity)

### What I found

* No additional townland beyond “Croom” was confirmed from accessible sources in this pass.

### Recommended next steps (web-only)

* Focus on documents most likely to name a townland:

  * Naturalization petitions
  * Obituaries (sometimes surprisingly specific)
  * Parish register images (your NLI/Ancestry lead is the right kind of source)

---

## One concrete conflict already visible: Anne B. Gleeson marriage timing

* WikiTree currently states Raymond Mowrey and Anne Barbara Gleeson married **in 1930 in Arizona**. ([WikiTree][6])
  This conflicts with your note about an **Arizona record suggesting 1 Jun 1921**. That’s a good example of why you’ll want the **actual AZ marriage record image or index entry** to anchor the date.

If you want the fastest path to unlock Maria’s parentage with the least “tree noise,” the sequence is:

1. **1916 death certificate (Maria)** → parents’ names + informant
2. **1870 census (Sauk, Ironton/Sumpter)** → household proof
3. **1880 census** → confirm siblings + parents’ Irish birthplaces

If you paste *just one* record image transcription (e.g., the 1870 census household or the 1916 death cert parent fields), I can immediately reconcile the conflicting parent sets and build the Fitzgerald family group cleanly.
